    "extdesc"     : "\nThis is the Automatic version 2.0.3 readme file.\nThis file will tell you what Automatic is, how to install it \nand how to contact me.\n\nWhat is Automatic?\nAutomatic is a script I made the first version of for some time back.\nThe 1.x scripts where programmed in a way I'm not to proved of. I have tried \nto make this better in this version, and I have therefor reprogrammed the \nentire script.\n\nWhat it does is that it (tries to) take care of all the user file handling. \nIt does not delete old users who haven't been seen by the bot in a number of \ndays (check my cleanup script for that job). It adds new users as they join, \nand updates all the hosts of the users if someone was to join using a new one.\n\nIt also makes it possible for the user to add new alternative nicks to \nhis/her user info. The user will automatically be asked if he/she wants to do \nso if they join using a new nick. This script now uses the same way the \naltnick script does to save alternative nick names. This mean you'll need to \ninstall the altnick3.tcl on your bot. Download that script and read \nthe first lines of the script for more info on altnick.\n\nWhy use altnick?\nI think the altnick script is the closest thing eggdrop have to a standard \nway of saving and registrating alternative nick names. \nIt's easy to use in your own scripts, and it does it in a fast and safe way.\n\nWhat about people who have been using the 1.x scripts, will they need to \nremove the old way of saving alternative nick names, and add them all over \nagain manually?\nOf course not! I used some time on making this script convert the old way \ninto the altnick3.tcl way. \nAll you'll need to do is to type .autoconv as a master/owner in a dcc chat \nor telnet connection with your bot after you have installed the script \ncorrectly. The time it takes depend on all from what server your bot is \nrunning on to how many users your bot knows. Your bot might \"freeze\" or \nbecome a lot slower while it converts the userfile, but that's normal, \nso don't panic.\nI will in no way guaranty that the script is 100% successful,\nbut what it does is this:\n\n    It scans true the user file searching for hosts looking like this:\n        *!*@<unknown>.data\n        <unknown>*!<unkown>@<unknown>\n\nWhat it does with a host looking like the first one, is that it stripes away \nevery thing but the <unknown> part, and then it adds the unknown part \n(who now should be a alternative nick for that user) as a altnick using \naltnick3.tcl. It then removes the .data host.\nOn the other host, it makes it look like this: <unknown>!<unknown>@<unknown>, \nand it adds a +C (not +c, but +C!) to the user. \nThis makes the Automatic script handle this user in a different way when it \nwant to add a new host.\n\nWhat else is new?\nThe script now has full support for alternative nicks. This means that if \nsomeone having a main handle like girl19 should join using a known \nalternative nick girl-19 and at the same time having a new host, the script \nunderstand that this is girl19, and adds the new host to girl19, \nand not add girl-19 as a new user as the 1.x scripts would have done.\nThe script should also be more eggdrop friendly, and not trigger some bugs \ninn irc.c (or something like that). \n\nI have also removed every thing else that you can find in 1.x scripts. \nThis is the greet part, away part, split notice part, and info text with far\nto many lines logged when someone joins and so on. \nThe script will also no longer send a message of way to many lines if \nsomeone joins using a new unknown nick. It will now just send ONE line. \nUsers may also now use /msg <bot> help altnick, /msg <bot> help newnick and \n/msg <bot> help newuser (this requires that you have the help file loaded!).\n\nIt's now also more easy to make the script send a different line of text if\nthis and that should happen since they are all located at the same place \n(at the start of the script). If you want to make the script use a different \nlanguage then english, you shouldn't have to big problems I hope :)\nYou can also make the script ignore a user (so that the script will not \nnotice this user and so on) by giving that user a +N flag \n(use .chattr <handle> +N). \nIt also work on bot's (+b users) in the same way.\nWell.. I hope that's about it. I have tested it for several months now, \nand haven't found any bugs.\n\nOkey, how do you install it then?\nEasy.. copy the script file (automatic_v2.0.2.tcl) and the altnick script \n(altnick3.tcl) to the scripts dir. \nThen copy the automatic.help file to the help/msg dir.\n\nNow at the end of your bot config file, add these lines:\n\nsource scripts/altnick3.tcl\nsource scripts/automatic_v2.0.2.tcl\nloadhelp automatic.help\n\nAlso do remember to config the script! See the first lines of the script file.\n\nThat's it. Now just restart your bot.\n\nI need to contact you for some reason, how?\nIf you want to contact me because you found a bug, you have an idea for the \nscript or you just need someone to talk to :), \nsend a mail to cfelde@powertech.no.\nIf (and ONLY if!) that email address doesn't work, \nplease try cfelde@hotmail.com.\n\nWhat if I just found this readme file somewhere, but not the script, \nwhere would I go find it?\nThis script has been uploaded to ftp.sodre.net, and should be in \n/pub/eggdrop/scripts1.3 \n(if they don't change something, or something goes wrong).\n\nHope that's all the info you'll need.\n\nChristian Felde\n"

For reasons which will be\nobvious when you think about it (it will divide the period you set rather\nirregularly) it can only be run on one bot per channel at a time, but this\nscript will automatically keep the channel limit set to an acceptable level\nabove the maximum number, and will only change it on an interval you specify.\nIt will *not* mode flood, or re-set the same channel limit over and over\nagain, and you can even specify a grace value, so that if the actual limit\nis sufficiently close to the ideal limit, the bot won't bother changing it\n(after all, people will still be able to get in, unless you set a really\nabsure grace value).\n\nFor people who are baffled easily, I suggest NEVER using a grace value that is\nmore than 1/4 of the ceiling value.  And if you don't have oddles of free time\non your hands to do metrics, just set the period at sometime between three and\nten minutes.

Most of the settings are default and probably should be used\n    (you can figure this out).\n\n    Then upload eggdrop1.4.0 (or a newever version), untar, ./configure,\n    make (make install after that if you wish), and your eggdrop is ready.\n    Then upload the jIRCserv.tcl to your shell, and put it in your scripts\n    directory, edit motd.txt to your liking and upload it to your shell and\n    move it wherever you set in jIRCserv.tcl (the dvs_fserve(motd) variable).\n\n    Finally, edit your config file and put the line:\n       source scripts/jIRCserv.tcl\n    at the bottom of it (caps are required...

(At least this is what\nits _meant_ to do :)\n\nSETUP:\n 1. Unpack the tar archive into your eggdrop directory --\n      it should put link.tcl into your scripts directory\n      (<eggdrop dir>/scripts by default) and put linkhelp.*\n      into your eggdrop directory.\n\n 2. Edit the script itself (link.tcl) and read the top 20 lines or so.\n\n 3. Add it to your eggdrop configuration file, ie add\n     \"  source scripts/link.tcl \"      to your config.\n\n 4. Rehash/reload/whatever, just do something to get it to re-read its\n      config :)\n\n\nTODO:\n  * Fix up 'who' command so it tells you if there's no one\n    on the other networks. At the moment, all it does is\n    send out a request for info, and wait for a reply -\n    if there's no reply, it doesn't tell the user. (ie\n    if there's no one on the other networks, it won't say\n    anything) \n  * Fix up the help files maybe? They're pretty cruddy :)\n\n\nIf you have any suggestions as to things to add to the script,\nor comments/bug reports please mail them to gumby@ign.com.au.\n\nIf you make any groovy modifications to the script please send\nthem in too :)\n\nHope it works well for you :)\n\nGoo\n3rd Dec '97\n"

It might be useful if you\nhave a disc-quota or if your bot logs a lot of channels.\n\nLogZipper zips all \".yesterday\" (or \".${logfile-suffix}\") logfiles\nit can find in a given directory, adds yesterday's date to the\nfilename and deletes the original log. The zipped log can then\nbe mailed to various recipients (as an attachment, of course ;-))\nIf you decide that keeping logs for more than x days is not\nnecessary, LogZipper compares their last modification dates (mtime)\nto the current date and deletes all zips which age _exceed_ x days.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n**********************************************************************\n\nset lz(logloc) \"logs/\"\n\n\tlz(logloc) is the relative path of the directory where you\n\tkeep the logfiles. Leave trailing / as is.\n\nset lz(duration) 2\n\n\tlz(duration) is the amount of days you want to keep the\n\tzipped logs. Every day, the logs which age exceeds\n\tlz(duration) days, will be deleted. Set to 0 in order\n\tto never delete any log.\n\nset lz(sendlogs) 0\n\n\tlz(sendlogs) determines whether you want to have the bot\n\tsend any of the zipped logs to someone.\n\t0 = don't, 1 = yes, please\n\nset lz_recipient(1) \"user@mail log1.log #channel1.log #channel2.log\"\n\n\tHere's the difficult part of this script. Logzipper\n\tneeds to know what user shall receive which logs.\n\t\n\tTherefore, within the quotes of the variable, you type\n\tthe email adress of the receiver in the first position.\n\there: user@mail\n\tIn the second, third, fourth, nth position, you assign\n\t_all_ logs the user shall receive - just use the same\n\tfilenames as you have defined in the bot config file.\n\tThat's the first part.\n\t\n\tNow, you might want to send logs to more than one user.\n\tNotice the \"1\" right after lz_recipients. For the next\n\tperson to receive the same or other logs, copy the whole\n\tline and replace the 1 by a 2, e.g.:\n\t\n\tset lz_recipient(2) \"user2@anothermail log1.log log4.log\"\n\n\tRepeat this until all recipients are determined.\n\nHave fun\n"

This is usually set\n#  to M (master). \n#\n#  whoset   <trigger>whoset  - show who set a definition\n#        trigger example \"!whoset someword\"\n#\n#   As a configured NotePOD OWNER, (configuration option script_owners) \n#   you can LOCK a definition by prepending : (colon) when using the learn\n#   or replace commands.\n#   The following commands allow you to lock/unlock a pre-existing definition.\n#   puthelp \"PRIVMSG $nick :\\00313$NP_trigger_Lockdef <def>\\003 -\n#            lock a current definition.\"\n#   lockdef <word>\n#   unlockdef <word>\n#\n## DCC +m commands:\n#\n#  \n#    .np learn , forget, replace, whoset same as for channel commands\n#\n#    .np show      - dcc equivalent of explain, \n#            - this is raw mode showing whoset also\n#    .np wshow     - dcc equivalent of scan\n#    .np bshow     - dcc equivalent of scanbody\n#    .np nshow     - dcc equivalent of scannick\n#\n#    .np getlist      - send definition list\n#    .np gethist      - send definition change history\n#    .np getsync      - send definition sync file\n#\n#    .np forcesync    - force def list sync on target bot\n#    .np killsync     - delete pending def resync list\n#\n#    .np update    - update def list on target bot\n#            - bot DCC sends list to target bot\n#\n#    .np move <sync|list> - install new synclist or deflist\n#            - that was DCCed to bot by owner\n#    .np sort      - sort the def list\n#\n#\n## Definition Sorting:\n#\n# Definition list is sorted on restart, rehash and via dcc command. \n# A backup file is made.\n#\n#\n## Definition Syncing:\n#\n# When operated on two bots, NotePOD tries to keep the definition files in\n# sync on both. It accompishes this via the botnet link, issuing putbot \n# commands as required. \n#\n# Both bots execute learn, replace & forget, but only the primary NotePod bot\n# will reply to channel explain and scan commands. \n# When the primary goes offline/channel, the secondary takes over \n# public/msged replies. Both bots store all changes made in a sync file\n# while the other is offline.\n# If bots are linked but on split channels, def sync is done via botnet.\n# When a bot relinks, the other will update it via the botnet.\n# If synclist is greater that 1k, sync is not done and a note will be sent\n# to the bot OWNER. IN this case, the owner must use the .np update command\n# to update the other bot.\n# If synclist is 51 bytes, this indicates bot has a default list and it \n# will automatically request, via the botnet, the current def list from the \n# other bot. A note will be sent to OWNER.\n#\n# Both bots MUST have x flag for each other, and you should have an inbound\n# directory defined and created on each. They need to be botlinked also :)\n#\n# IF both go offline/channel, yer screwed, don't bug me.\n#   Amadeus`\n#\n#############################################################################\n#\n"

This is the Windows version of sendftp !!!\n\nThis is a proc to send a file via FTP to another server.

I won't give any more comments ;-)\n\n V1.6\n    -Removed WHEN-command because of uselessness. Use seen if needed!\n    -Changed 'Last on' to use chanrecords\n    -Optimized almost everything. Now takes MUCH less CPU-time!\n    -Added stylesheet usability.\n    -Added comment lines before procs :-)\n    -People with 0 words aren't shown on web or any other lists.\n\n V1.52\n    -Fixed several non-fatal bugs and made some little \"pitchings\".\n    -Changed the layout a little. \n\n V1.51\n    -Never published, was just on own use.\n\n V1.5 \n    -Now StatWWW works with Eggdrop version greater than 1.2.0  only.\n    -Added multichannel support.\n    -Fastlog feature removed because in multichannel use you should have   \n     so many logfiles and to reduce taking CPU-time.\n    -Lynxfile (plain txt-file) feature removed also for same reason.\n    -Removed flag 2 usage and changed locking to flag o (oper)\n    -Changed usage of flag 1 to flag 5\n    -Changed totally the stats' saveformat in userfile.\n    -Added WEED-command.

That prevents userfile getting huge.\n   -Added DOSTATS dcc-command, see below\n\n V1.3\n   -Fixed bug with words/pubs, no more division by zero.\n   -Fixed bug with auto_adduser\n   -People can now ask somebody else's stats, see below\n   -Added TOPTEN command, see below\n\n V1.2\n   -STAT-command tells also idletime if user is on channel.\n   -Fixed some little bugs in several places\n   -Added words/publics section (Suggested by Luosto)\n   \n V1.1\n   -Fixed bug with actions, they go to the logs now.\n   -Fixed some little bugs in several places\n   -Fixed bug with count_words, no more errormsg with nonexistent users\n\n\n##########################################################################\n## ================== DCC COMMANDS TO HANDLE THE STATS ================ ##\n##########################################################################\n                      (only masters can use these)\n CLRUSER <handle>\n    Sets somebody's all stats to 0 \n SUMUSER <handle1> <handle2>\n    Adds handle2's hostmask(s) and stats to handle1 and deletes handle2\n DOSTATS\n    Instantly creates the new html-file(s).\n WEED <words>\n    Deletes users who have less than <words> words on ALL separate \n    channels except if they have master, op or voice flag.\n\n##########################################################################\n## ============================ MSG COMMANDS ========================== ##\n##########################################################################\n                        (everybody can use these)\n STAT\n    Sends a notice to the user and tells his/her statistics\n WHEN <nick> <channel>\n    Sends a notice to the user and tells when <nick> was last on channel\n TOPTEN <channel>\n    Says top ten talkers on <channel> and their wordcounts.\n PLACE <channel>\n    Tells user's place on list and wordcount on <channel>.\n##########################################################################\n## ========================== PUBLIC COMMANDS ========================= ##\n##########################################################################\n                        (everybody can use these)\n !STAT [nick]\n    Tells user's (or nick's if given) statistics on current channel.\n !WHEN <nick>\n    Tells when nick was last on current channel.\n !TOPTEN\n    Says top ten talkers and their wordcounts on current channel.\n !PLACE [nick]\n    Tells user's (or nick's if given) place on list and wordcount\n    on current channel.\n\n ================ SPECIAL FLAGS USED BY THIS SCRIPT: ===================\n 5 = Do not include this user to the html and !topten output. \n     This uses channel specific flag, so it must be set for all channels\n    (counting still works so they can use STAT-command)\n\nMore documentation on comment lines in the script's settings-section.\n"

(CPU load would be too\n   high otherwise.)\n  * Channel topic may only be changed with a frequency of once every 60\n   seconds.\n  * Only masters, owners, or other bots may change a topic before the\n   60 second topic lock has expired.  (This *might* work on more than one\n   bot per channel at a time.)\n  * To discourage people from trying to 'race' the bot, users who attempt\n   to change the topic before the timer has expired will be thwarted and\n   reminded to wait however many seconds are left.\n  * Users will only be warned once per locking period, to avoid someone\n   trying to force the bot to flood itself off.\n\nNote:  This script requires that you use Eggdrop 1.3.15.  There are way too\n many people reporting bugs in eggdrop lately who failed to ask themselves,\n \"Am I running the latest version?\"\n\nYes, I know it was slack of me, but I found one last little bug where if\na master/owner changed the topic manually, it would unlock the topic,\nbut it would also NOT exit the proc, and go ahead and change it back anyway.\n\nI think we've pretty much worked out the LAST 'left out' thing now.  Please\naccept my apologies for doing three changes in one night.  (I am not a devel\nkernel person, I promise!  Heh.)\n\n(I'm not going to look, but I think I uploaded a copy of the script as the\n.desc file the last time, too.  I NEED SLEEP!)\n"

The script contains modified portions of his\nbseen1.4.2c.tcl script. If it script does not work, causes problems\nor whatever, he is _not_ the appropriate person to contact (look\nabove for my email adress).\n\nDESCRIPTION\n**********************************************************************\n\nWebSeen is a CGI web interface for the seen database created by Bass' \neggdrop script bseen1.4.2c. It allows any user to query seen data\nfor a given user. The Tcl does so by searching the bseen database file\nwhich is saved to disc in regular intervals.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n**********************************************************************\n\n- An eggdrop running bseen1.4.2c (earlier versions might work, but not\n  tested)\n- The webpage containing the form must be on the same server like the\n  bseen database\n- TCL 8.3 must be available (earlier versions might work, but not\n  tested)\n\nNice, but not necessary (and has to be done by you):\n\n- A very small patch of the bseen1.4.2c.tcl script.\n\nINSTALLATION\n**********************************************************************\n\n- configure the script and create an html. In the html, include a\n  form like this:\n\n  <form method=GET action=http://yoururl/pathtocgi-bin/webseen.cgi>\n  <input type=text value=NICK name=NICK size=20>\n  </form>\n  \n  upload the page to your website.\n \n(- patch the bseen script according to instructions given below)\n- Upload webseen.cgi to the CGI directory of your website\n- chmod it 755\n\nCONFIGURATION\n**********************************************************************\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/tclsh8.3\n\nIn the very first line, enter the path to the tcl executable. Make\nsure you _included_ the # at the beginning. Your line should look\nsimilar to the one above.\n\nset pathtodata \"/usr/home/YourBot/bs_data.YourBot\"\n\nThis is the full path to the bseen database.\n\nset pathtocgi \"../cgi-bin/gcwebseen.cgi\"\n\nThis is the relative path to the cgi\n\nset excludechannels \"#foo #bar #foobar\"\n\nAny channels you want to exclude from the search? Put them here,\ndelimited by space\n\nset excludeseenonbot 0\n\nIf the script should not return results about users from the partyline\nset this to 0, else 1\n\nset maxresults 25\n\nHow many results should be returned maximum ?\n\nset htmlfont \"verdana\"\n\nThe generated HTML is quite simple and worth hacking it, however,\nhere you can adapt the used font.\n\nPATCHING bseen1.4.2c.tcl\n**********************************************************************\n\nOriginally, bseen saves its data 12 minutes past the full hour. Since\nthe webseen.cgi requires the database file, more accurate search \nresults can be achieved if bseen saves more often. Saving the database\nis invoked by this line within the bseen script:\n\nbind time - \"12 * * * *\" bs_timedsave\n\nChanging this line to\n\nbind time - \"*0 * * * *\" bs_timedsave\n\ncauses bseen to save its data every 10 minutes.\nSave and restart the bot (a rehash won't do, since binds survive\nrehash'es)\n\nUnneccessary to say that neither me nor Bass take responsibility for\nthis patch.\n"

General info\n2.     History\n3.     Installation & usage\n4.     Conditions of use\n5.     Thanks\n\nAppendix A: Detailed descriptions of all settings.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. GENERAL INFO\n---------------\n\nI made this script because I couldn't find a trivia game \nfor eggdrop which worked the way I wanted. I first wrote \na trivia game script for mIRC which more or less looked \nlike the one used on #trivia on irc.blabber.net. I then \ndecided to run my own trivia game using eggdrop instead. \nThis script still looks more or less like the one used \non #trivia, it's just that the commands and features \ndiffer in certain respects.\n\nThis script was developed on eggdrop 1.6.4+. While it \nshould work on any of the 1.6 series, I have not tested \nit on anything below 1.6.4. Also note that this is the \nfirst TCL script I've written and I am by no means \nany kind of expert, so I expect that there may be more \nefficient ways of doing some things in places. If you \nhave any tips you'd like to share, you can contact me \nat the e-mail address at the top of this file. =)\n\n2. HISTORY\n----------\n\n28 July 2001   v1.01  First release.\n4 August 2001  v1.02  Added: auto disable after X unanswered\n                             questions. (set tgmaxmissed).\n                      Removed: check on load if channel set for\n                               the game is a valid channel.\n\t\t               Was causing some problems.\n                      Added: you can specify if you want the bot\n                             to use bold in messages or not.\n\t\t\t        (set tgusebold).\n                      Added: you can now disable winning streaks\n                             if you want to. (set tgstreakmin 0).\n\n3. INSTALLATION & USAGE\n-----------------------\n\nTo use the script:\n - extract all the files in the archive to a directory on your shell.\n - edit the trivia.tcl file to customise the settings to your liking.\n   (skip this step at your own risk ;).\n - add the script to your bot's config. see the eggdrop documentation\n   if you don't know how to do this.\n - rehash your bot and you're ready to go. =)\n\nNOTE:\n - make sure that alltools.tcl 1.6 or higher is loaded in your bot's\n   config. Also, make sure that it loads before trivia.tcl\n - make sure that the file you set for the question/answers database\n   exists, or your bot will DIE and you'll have to restart it.\n - the question database included is a sample for example purposes.\n   Add more questions by following the format of the example file,\n   i.e. one question/answer pair per line, answer first, then\n   question, seperated by a '|'. It does not need to be in any order,\n   I just find it easier to prevent adding a duplicate question if\n   my database is sorted alphabetically by answer.\n\nIf you've done this and rehashed the bot (and it didn't DIE =),\nyou can start the game by typing the start command on the\nchannel you specified.\n\nThe default channel commands (and flags required for their use) are:\n\nCommand       Flags      Description\n\n!start        -|-        Starts the game (if it's not running).\n!stop         o|o        Stops the game (if it's running).\n!hint         o|o        Gives another hint to the current question.\n!skip         o|o        Skips the question and selects a new one.\n\nThe default /msg commands (and flags required for their use) are:\n\nCommand       Flags      Description\n\n?             n/a        Gives help.\nscore         n/a        Looks up someones score.\ntarget        n/a        Tells you who is ranked one above you.\nerror         n/a        Report errors in questions/answers.\nreset         n|n        Reset score table.\n\n4. CONDITIONS OF USE\n--------------------\n\nYou have my permission to do anything you like with this script,\nas long as you give me credit for anything you used from it. =)\n\n5. THANKS\n---------\n\nThanks to...\n\n - The helpful folks on Undernet's #eggdrop for answering my newbie\n   questions. =)\n - The guy who originally wrote the mIRC trivia script as used on\n   blabber.net and various other places.\n - Prince_of_Chaos @ irc.blabber.net: assisting with beta testing.\n - stuuu @ irc.xnet.org, #xnet-trivia & #gimp:\n                                      bug reports and suggestions.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n----------\n\nThis is a list of all the variable settings used by the script\nand what they are for.\n\nset tgqdb\nSet this to the name of the file to use for questions and answers.\nThe account the bot runs on must be able to read from this file.\n\n  Example: set tgqdb \"/home/lamer/eggdrop/scripts/trivia.questions\"\n\nset tgscf\nSet this to the name of the file to use for the score table.\nThe acct the bot runs on must have read & write access to this file.\nIf the file does not exist, it will be created when needed.\n\n  Example: set tgscf \"/home/lamer/eggdrop/scripts/trivia.scores\"\n\nset tgerrfil\nSet this to the name of the file to use for error reports.\nThe acct the bot runs on must have read & write access to this file.\nIf the file does not exist, it will be created when needed.\n\n  Example: set tgerrfil \"/home/lamer/eggdrop/scripts/trivia.errors\"\n\nset tgchan\nSet the name of the channel you want the trivia game to run on.\n\n  Example: set tgchan \"#lame\"\n\nset tgpointsperanswer\nSet the number of points to give a person for a correct answer.\n\n  Example: set tgpointsperanswer 3\n\nset tgmaxhint\nSet the max number of hints to give before the question \"expires\".\nNote that the first hint given when the question is asked is not\nincluded in this total.\n\n  Example: set tgmaxhint 3\n\nset tgstreakmin\nSet the min number of correct answers in a row by one person which\nputs them on a winning streak.

This bot then relays the information back to\nthe main bot, where the list is updated.\nNo bot will be used twice in a row: the list is cycled repeatedly.\n\nYou may wonder what the purpose of using this method is. \nPrevious versions of nSPLiT (prior to v1.00) had the main bot request a \nLINKS from the server. If there were a lot of splits, or if the update\ntime was brief, the server would ban the bot for linklooking.  \nUnder the new method, the bot who actually sends the LINKS always varies, \nso there is very little chance of the bots being banned (unless of course\nyou only have 2 bots in your botnet). In my botnet of 33 bots, the script\nprevents all bans.\n\nIf you require a greater indepth explanation, read through the code:\n   It's all commented for explanation.\n\nThis script relies on a master server list.  The first time you run it, \nthe list will be generated from the servers currently linked. If you wish \nto update the master list after this, (which is a good idea) you must \nuse the dcc command  \".updatelinks\"\n\nPlease note that the original files will be generated only after the bot \nhas completed all of its other startip tasks (like asking for ops,\ninvites, etc).\nGive it a few minutes before you write me and tell me it's not working!!!\n\nIf you wish to manually update the list, the format is simply a 1 line \nfile with each server seperated by a @\nExample:\nirc.aaa.com@irc.bbb.net@irc.ccc.org@\n\nNote the trailing @ !  That is important....\n\n##################################\nINSTALLATION:\n\n-As I have said before, this is a netbots component!\n-Therefore, your botnet must be running netbots to user this script.\n-It has been tested on eggdrop1.6.6 with netbots v3.80\n-Compatability withprevious versions is not guaranteed.\n\nSTEP ONE:\nPut nsplit.tcl in your netbots directory of the main bot\n\nSTEP TWO:\nEdit the netset.tcl of your main bot.  Add the following info:\n set nb_component(nsplit) 1     <-Tells netbots to load the nsplit component\n set ns_bot \"bitchtits\"         <-The name of the main bot as specified in\n                                  its conf\n set ns_offlinebots \"Hubbot\"    <-Names of any offline bots who cannot send\n                                  LINKS commands\n set ns_lnklst \"/bot/links.lst\" <-Full path to the Master Links file\n                                  (file will be created)\n set ns_lnktmp \"/bot/links.tmp\" <-Full path to the Current Links file\n                                  (file will be created)\n set ns_chan \"#lame\"            <-A channel where all your bots hang out\n                                  (used to determine if a bot is on the same\n\t\t\t\t   side of a split)\n set ns_updtt 30                <-Amount of time (in minutes) between\n                                  link updates\n set ns_showhubs 0              <- 0/1 - 0 will exclude hubs from being\n                                  displayed on the public command.\n set ns_hublist [list ircd irc-h hub services]\n                                <-A list of terms to search for to determine\n\t\t\t\t  if a server is a hub.\n                                  (this list is set for EFNet)\n\nSTEP THREE:\nRehash your main bot.\nMake sure the following information is displayed on rehash:\n Loading netbots.tcl v3.80 by slennox..\n Loaded components: etc etc, nsplit, etc etc\n \nSTEP FOUR:\nUpdate all the netbots!\n Use \".netupdate -file netbots/nsplit.tcl\" to send out the new file.\n This assumes you are using a netbots directory in the bot's root dir.\n    Some people may have to change this to scripts/netbots/nsplit.tcl.\n Use \".netupdate -settings\" to send out the new netset.tcl\n \n\nThat's it.\n\nAny questions?\nDirect them to jestrix@jestrix.net or find me in #jiso on efnet\n\n\n##################################\nCOMMANDS:\n\n--In the partyline (owners only):\n   .updatelinks    -  refreshes the master list\n   .getlinks ?bot? -  refreshes the current link list.\n                      If a bot is specified, that bot will send\n                      out the LINKS command to the server.\n\n--In the channel:\n   !netsplits    -  lists current netsplits.\n                    If the current links list is not available for some\n                    reason, the channel will recieve the following error:\n                    nSPLiT 1.01 Splits are currently unavailable\n       \n##################################\nVersion History \n\nv1.01 - bug free reworking of v1.00\nv1.00 - complete rewrite as netbots component (buggy - not public)\nv0.25 - partial rewrite to help prevent links flooding\nv0.20 - Initial public release\n\n\n/me thanks Mooeyenz for the substance abuse counseling required to\n    write this script.\n"

Read sections below !\n\nDESCRIPTION\n********************************************************************\n\nYet another quote script! Anyway, I think it differs in many ways\nfrom the others, so it might be useful for someone out there.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Quotes can be toggled as channel-specific.\n- All quotes are indexed (therefore accessable via their indices)\n- Easy searching for specific quote(s) (No fiddling with *? etc)\n- Addition and deletion of quotes in PUB and DCC\n- Random quoting\n- Scheduled quoting (bot spits a random quote every x minutes)\n- Quoting when botname is mentioned in channel\n- Logging of additions and deletions\n- Overview of recently added quotes without having to wade through\n  the .dat file\n- Notification of a bot user when new quotes have arrived.\n- If channel-specific quotes is enabled, quotes can be copied from\n  one channel to another. Also, the quotes for a whole channel can\n  be deleted.\n\nA short note on the first feature:\n\nYou can make QuoteBot use channel-independent databases. That means,\nquotes added in channel #a are not available in channel #b and vice\nversa. If so, some special syntax on some DCC comands is need, but\nQuoteBot will tell you about that. It doesn't matter when you enable\nor disable this feature since from the beginning, QuoteBot will\nassign each quote to its specific channel. The difference is,\nthat if the feature is disabled, it just doesn't tell you. If it is\ndisabled, quotes added in DCC are assigned to channel #quotebot.\nIf you decide to enable channel-specific quotes lateron, you can\neasily copy the quotes to all desired channels.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n********************************************************************\n\naddquote <quote>\nPUB & DCC -|-\nAdds a quote. Checks submitted quote against all quotes in database\nand refuses to add if it already exists.\n\nquote [mask|index]\nPUB -|-\nIf no argument is given, the bot returns a random quote.\nIf mask is given, it returns the first quote matching mask. If mask\nreturns more than one result, doing another .quote with the same mask\ndisplays the second quote matching mask and so on, starting all over\nat 0 matches. Using * and ? as search masks is not necessary.\nIf index is given, the bot returns the quote with that index.\n\ntalk <on|off> [minutes]\nPUB m|m\nEnables or disables scheduled quoting every [minutes] minutes.\nIf [minutes] is omitted, 30 minutes is used as default.

All quotes are assigned to channel #quotebot.\nIf you chose to have channel-specific quotes enabled, you should\nnow copy the quotes to their channels.\n\nHISTORY\n********************************************************************\n\n1.21\n- Fixed error \"Tcl error [q_deldcc]: can't read 'q_temp2':\n  no such variable\".\n- Fixed error that when deleting in DCC, deleted quotes\n  weren't logged.\n\n1.2\n- Fixed error \"TCL error: list element in quotes followed by ','\n  instead of space\" when doing .newquotes and one of the quotes\n  contained comma(ta).\n- Fixed case sensitivity error for .delquote\n- Quotes are now indexed in order to make adminstration easier:\n  New DCC command \"delindex <#> [# .. n]\": deletes quotes with\n  indices # [# ..n].  Indices can be obtained by .listquotes\n  (.newquotes also shows indices)\n- Added possibility of having a note sent to someone when new\n  quotes are available.\n\n1.1\n- So far, logging was mandatory. Now it's an option\n- Slightly changed the way data is logged - when updating,\n    a .restart is strongly recommended\n- Fixed minor bug regarding file operations which occured\n    under rare circumstances\t\t  \n- Added DCC command \"addquote\"\n- Added DCC command \"delquote\"\n- Added DCC command \"listquotes\": for administrative purposes only,\n    it shows all quotes matching <mask> at once.\n- Added DCC command \"newquotes\": shows all recently added quotes\n  since \"newquotes\" was used last time\n- Cosmetic changes to the code\n- Added definable trigger character\n\t\n1.01\n- From 1.6.4 on, eggdrop correctly displays UTF8 characters no\n  regsubbing üöä etc. anymore.  Script checks for $numversion\n  and regsubs only if smaller than 1060400.\n- Added maximum length of quote.\n\n1.0f\nFirst public release\n\nEOF\n"

Introduction\n---------------\n\nThis is a (not so) short README for Moxons quiz/trivia script.\n\nMoxQuizz is a multilingual quiz/trivia script for the popular IRC bot\neggdrop, acting as a game master playing a quiz.  Normally, a question\nis posted to the channel and all chatter is searched for the answer.\nIf something matches an answer or an optional regular expression, the\nuser who said it receives a score.  The high-score table will be\nprinted regularly (see rankdelay in TCL file).  When a player reaches\na certain score, he wins the quiz and the rankings will be reseted.\nA score is recorded in the allstars table, too.\n\nYou can use your own question files (they are always welcome to be\nincluded in future distributions).  See README.database for a\ndescription of the file format.  Currently sets for several languages\nare provides as well as language definitions for the messages MoxQuizz\nemmits.\n\nMoxQuizz was completely written from scratch.  It requires eggdrop\n1.6.8 or later together with TCL 8.3.2 or later.\n\nYou can find an instance of MoxQuizz running in #quiz and #quiz.de on\nDALNet (since November 2000).\n\nThe impatient read section 1 for the most important stuff.  If you are\nnot planning to run a script/bot for yourself, you can skip sections 4\nto 6.  If you want to control the script, read section 4.  If you plan\nto install a script/bot for you own, read 5 and 6 as well as the\nINSTALL file.\n\nAll configuration variables mentioned can be changed in the file\nmoxquizz.rc  See section 5 for more information about configuration\nand additional features like colors on/off, allstars computed monthly,\netc.\n\n\n1. Quickstart\n-------------\n\nThis section briefly tells, what you definitely must know before you\nstart listed as separate items.  You should have installed an eggdrop\nand have read INSTALL.\n\n\t- You need the flags P and Q to be able to control the game.\n\n\t- To start the game, simply start the eggdrop with the script\n          loaded and say:\n\t    !ask\n\t  in your quiz channel.\n\n\t- Control the quiz from a dcc connection to the script/bot.\n\n\t- All control commands are prefixed with:  .!\n\n\t- Safely shutdown the quiz (and the let the bot terminate)\n          with:\n\t    .!exit\n\t  from within a dcc connection.\n\n\t- Pause a running game with .!pause and continue with .!cont\n\n\n2. Detailed descripton\n----------------------\n\nThis section needs to be written more thoroughly -- maybe this gets\nnever done, since many things are rather technical and should not\nbother you if you are a normal user.  Besides that it might be\ninteressting.\n\n- Channel desert detection\n\n  MoxQuizz detects if nobody is talking to the channel for a while and\n  halts the quiz automatically.  The time of silence is\n  $useractivetime seconds and will be checked in the tip giving\n  function.\n\n- Regular Expressions -- regexp\n\n  MoxQuizz is able to match answers with a regular expression.  This\n  is a very powerful tool allowing you match a wide range of answers\n  including alternatives, different orders (done with alternatives :),\n  optional parts, common typos etc etc.  Search for regexp with the\n  search engine you like to get enlightened, you will love it.\n\n- Allstars table\n\n  Allstars data is stored with username, so users playing with\n  different nicks get several entries.  The hostmask is stored, so\n  that the list can be edited by hand.  This might be replaced by\n  something better.  You can use allstars.pl to prettyprint the table\n  as ASCII, HTML or XML.\n\n  The formula taken for the allstars computation is:\n\n                   Points in game               1\n  Sum over: 10 * ------------------ * ------------------------\n                 log10(your points)   your duration in seconds\n\n  By default the allstars table is computed for separately for each\n  month.  The script always serves only the current month.  This can be\n  changed (see optional features below).  The duration is the time the\n  player needed to win, i.e. the time between his/her first score and\n  the end of the game.\n\n- Game state\n\n  There are 5 game states: stop, halt, asked, waittoask and pause.\n  Asked and waittoask will change mutually while a game is in progress\n  and can temporary be left to pause (!pause) and then reentered with\n  !cont.  Halt and stop can be reached from everywhere.  The\n  difference among the last both is: from halt a new game can be\n  started by users with !ask, whereas the stop state must be left\n  explicit with !init or !halt (both change to state halt).\n\n- Bot exit\n\n  The script stores the ranks and all asked userquestions to disc (see\n  configuration section below for filenames)\n\n- Rehashing\n\n  The script tries to survive rehashing.  To achieve this, it writes\n  the ranks to disc and reloads them after the rehash.  Lofgiles are\n  tried to be reopened, too.\n\n- Optional features\n\n  The script has some features, which might or might not be enabled in\n  your bot.  Ask the botowner or check .!set from the partyline or\n  read moxquizz.rc.  I'll talk about the defaults here.  Check section\n  Configuration/Quiz Features for a detailed description.\n\n  The script can give tips from time to time (every 30th question or\n  so).  Currently it talks about common commands and features af the\n  script, like how to post userquestions, how to check allstars, etc etc.\n  This feature proved to be useful, since it learns users the basic\n  commands.\n\n  The script has a command !rules which show the user the channel\n  rules.  If you installed the script/bot for yourself, you probably\n  want to check moxquizz/quizdata/channelrules.txt.\n\n  Some channels have sentinel bots, which +im a channel when danger is\n  ahead.  MoxQuizz detects this and automatically pauses (this feature\n  is disabled by default).  Let the game continue by -m your channel\n  or .!cont from the partyline.\n  \n- moxtools.tcl\n\n  This is a set of tool functions not directly associated with the\n  quiz operation.  So far the following is included:\n\n  Announce  -- let the script announce a single message to each user\n               joining a channel the script is on.  Set the message with\n               !announce as master.\n\n  Antispam  -- If there is a file intl/antispam.txt, MoxQuizz will\n               send it to any user who says !antispam in the\n               channel.  This is meant to provide information about\n               how to avoid spammers on IRC (which was a big problem\n               on DALNet end of 2002).\n\n  Bad words -- the script recognizes a small set of bad words and kicks\n               of someone says them.  If the person repeats swearing\n               within a certain time he/she is banned for 30 minutes.\n\t       Disabled by default.\n\n  Identify  -- bot users with flag P can let a MoxQuizz manually\n               identify itself agains a nickserv by !identify on the\n               partyline.  This is because automatic identify doesn't\n               always work correctly.\n\n  Logfiles  -- function which creates a logfile for each channel the\n               script/bot joins.  I did not like the fact, that all\n               stuff is logged to a singe file not even tagged with\n               the channel name.\n  \n  Nickserv --  The script is able to identify itself to nickserv.\n               Specify hostmask and password.\n\n  VHosts   --  The script can automatically be set up for use a vhost.\n               Currently this works for me and probably won't work for\n               you (since I don't know how you get your vhost, please\n               tell me!)  Disabled by default.\n\n  Jump     --  Allows users with flag Q to let the bot jump to a\n               specific server (or to next server in list): !jump or\n               !jump <server>\n\n- Other channels\n\n  The script/bot can join other channels, but the quiz can only take\n  place in one channel at a time.  Note that the fun commands are\n  aviable in all channels, the script/bot is in (they are now\n  documented in README.moxfun)\n\n- What MoxQuizz is not/cannot:\n\n  . The game cannot run in more than one channel at a time (install\n    another eggdrop if you want this).\n\n  . Teamplay is planned since long, but still far ahead.  One can only\n    play for oneself.\n\n  . MoxQuizz will not help your users if they get addicted to quiz.\n\n- Multilingual:\n\n  Starting with version 0.8.0 MoxQuizz speaks several languages and\n  comes with question databases in a wide range.  Currently there are:\n\n  Language     Message set?  Question set?\n\n  english      yes           5437\n  french       yes           -\n  german       yes           6524\n  greek        yes           -\n  malaysian    -             3444\n  norwegian    -             566\n\n\n3. User commands\n----------------\n\nSeveral commands can be invoked by the user besides solving a question\nby simply saying them on the channel:\n\n   !allstars <n>   - shows you the first n positions in the current\n                     allstars table.  When ommitted, n defaults to 10.\n\n   !ask           - starts the quiz after is was halted/initialized or\n                    tells the user the actual question by /msg, if a\n                    question is open.\n\n   !comment <txt> - comment bugs, typos and any other things you want\n                    to be said.  If you refer to a question, make sure\n                    to mention it's number!\n\n   !hi            - Lets the script greet known ppl (bot users and ppl in\n                    the allstars table).\n\n   !score <nick>  - tells you <nick>s current scores.  Without <nick>\n                    it will be you own scores.\n\n   !rank <n>      - shows you the first n positions in the current rank\n                    list.  When ommitted, n defaults to 10.\n\n   !revolt        - can be used to show that a user dislikes a question.\n                    The script accepts revolts after at least one tip was\n                    given & solves automatically, if more than 50 percent\n                    of the people, who said something within the last\n                    'useractivetime' seconds (default 4 minutes),\n                    revolt.\n\n   !qhelp <topic> - same as !qhelp per msg.  See below for a description\n\n   !rules         - same as !rules per msg.  Lists the channel rules,\n                    if the script is configured with any.\n\n   !version       - reports version number and amount of known\n                    questions of MoxQuizz similiar to the on-join\n                    message.\n\nAdditionally, there are commands which can be sent as a /msg to the\nbot to ask user questions and do other things:\n\n   !userquest <question>::<answer>::<regexp>\n                  - ask a user question.  Specify at least question\n                    and answer.  Optional regexp is a TCL regexp to\n                    match. \"::\" separates the elements.  You further\n                    can enclose a region in the answer with #...# to\n                    mark text for tip generation and answer match.\n                    Your nick can then use !usertip, !usersolve\n                    and !usercancel.\n\t\t  \n                   Up to five questions will be scheduled, before a\n                   question is rejected.\n            Example: !userquest Who is my author?::Moxon\n\n   !usertip <tip> - immediately places a tip while in your userquest.\n                     Without <tip>, a default tip will be given.  The\n                     <tip> will be inserted into the list of generated\n                     tips and stored, too.\n\t\t  \n   !usercancel    - cancel a given userquestion or your question ahead\n\t\t  \n   !usersolve     - solves your userquestion\n\t\t  \n   !qhelp <topic> - gives an help text on <topic> or an overview.\n\n   !rules         - same as public !rules.  Lists the channel rules,\n                    if the script is configured with any.\n\n\n\n4. Commands to control the script\n---------------------------------\n\nThe script is controlled by sending him commands via /msg and dcc.  They\nare parted into commands which can be invoked by users known to the\nbot as quizmaster (flag P), quizadmin (flag Q) or bot master\n(flag m).  Note the user commands must be invoked by msg, whereas\nthose mentioned here must be invoked over a dcc chat session like\nthis (exceptions are !nuq, !uq and !listnuq):\n\n\t.!tip\nor\n\t. !tip\n\nThe \"!\" is there because of historical reasons and to avoid clashes\nwith other dcc commands.\n\nQuizmasters can control the quiz like starting and giving tips,\nquizadmins can manipulate the rank list and move the quiz to other\nchannels, the master can set certain system variables and let the bot\njoin other channels to sit around and friends can let the bot talk on\nany channel it is on.\n\nThe list following is ordered by function group, where each command is\npreceeded with the flag needed.  Note, that you only have to send the\ncommand without the flag.\n\n# quiz running status\n\n  P  !halt             \t- halt the script, and closes an open question\n                       \t  (ranks are kept safe).  Users can restart the\n                       \t  quizz with !ask !\n  P  !init             \t- init the script. The game can be started with !ask\n  P  !reset             - shortcut for sequence .!stop, .!rankreset, .!init\n  P  !stop             \t- stop the script, and closes an open question\n                       \t  (ranks are kept safe).  Quiz can only go\n                       \t  continued with !halt or !init.\n  P  !pause            \t- pauses the actual game.  A running game can\n                       \t  be continued with !cont (NOTE: !ask will not\n                       \t  continue here, but questions are kept open.)\n  P  !cont             \t- continues a previously paused game.\n  P  !status           \t- report the current status to you via /msg\n  m  !exit             \t- causes the script to save all its data (rank and\n                       \t  user questions), leave the current channel\n                       \t  and quit. \n  m  !aftergame <act>   - Specify what the script shall do after the current\n                          or next (if none open) game.  Valid values\n                          are: halt, stop, exit, newgame.  Except the\n                          last one all correspond to the !<act>\n                          command.  newgame will just start a new game.\n                          Note that aftergame is only considered when\n                          the game is won or the channel is detected\n                          desert.  This command is for automatic\n                          shutdown and stuff.\n\n# quiz configuration\n\n  m   !load              - load configuration from $configfile\n  m   !save              - save current configuration to $configfile\n  m   !set <key value>+\n                         - set some values from the configuration\n                           file.  This replaces !tipdelay, !askdelay,\n                           !tipdelay, !setwinscore and !restrict from\n                           0.6.x and prior.  Lists options and their\n                           value if no or a single argument is given,\n                           lists available keys if single argument\n                           matches more than one.\n\n# quiz control stuff like speaking and channel hopping\n\n  P   !say <txt>     - let the bot say something.  txt can start with\n                       #<chan> to talk to <chan>.  Default is quizchannel.\n  P   !act <txt>     - let the bot act in some way.  txt can start with\n                       #<chan> to act in <chan>.

If\n                        it is an optional tip, it will be inserted into\n                        the generated tip list.\n  P   !setscore <n>   - sets the score for the current question to\n                        <n>.  This will be noticed to the channel.\n\n  P   !skipuserquest  - skip the next (not the current) user question\n  m   !qsave          - save all user questions (in fact, they will be\n                        appended to their file, so that nothing gets\n                        lost).  The internal list will be cleared, so\n                        that the file contains questions only once.\n\t\t\tOnly questions already asked are saved, unless\n                        you specify 'all' as parameter.\n  Q  !reload <set>    - reload the question files.

Configuration/Quiz features\n------------------------------\n\nBesides that you can tune the script by changing several variables,\nthere are some features you can choose to enable/disable.  There is no\nneed to change the script itself, all changes you make are done in\nmoxquizz.rc in the quiz directory.\n\nFiles and directories (these are defined in the script itself, but you\nwon't change them):\n\n   quizbasedir        moxquizz\n   datadir            $quizbasedir/quizdata\n   configfile         $quizbasedir/moxquizz.rc\n   \n   rankfile           $datadir/rank.data\n   allstarsfile       $datadir/rankallstars.data\n   userqfile          $datadir/questions.user.new\n   commentsfile       $datadir/comments.txt\n   channeltipfile     $datadir/channeltips.txt\n   channelrulesfile   $datadir/channelrules.txt\n\nConfiguration variables in moxquizz.rc:\n\n   Things you sure wish to change:\n   -------------------------------\n\n   channelrules = yes      Print channel rules on !rules.

(yes/no)\n\n   questionset = en        All files in datadir with this extension\n                           will be considered as question sets and\n                           will be loaded on quiz startup.\n\n   quizchannel = #quiz     Channel the script will join on server connect\n                           and make the quiz.\n\n   language    = en        Besides having different sets of questions,\n                           the script speaks other languages than\n                           english.  It comes with a german language\n                           set, more will be added.\n\n   Features you might wish to enable/disable/change:\n   -------------------------------------------------\n\n   channeltips      = yes  enable/disable channeltips -- small\n                           helptexts postet now and then.

(yes/no)\n\n   monthly_allstars = yes  compute allstars table per month (yes/no)\n\n   msgwhisper       = no   If enabled, all information to users is\n                           given as PRIVMSG.   If disabled, it is\n                           given by NOTICE.

Check intl/*/prices.txt\n                           for a list of them\n\n   stripumlauts     = no   If you encounter problems with umlauts,\n                           enable this option.  All umlauts will be\n                           converted to their transliteration (this\n                           feature might vanish in the future).\n\n   Restriction Variables:\n   ----------------------\n\n   lastwinner_restriction = 1  Stops answer bots and too elite ppl.\n                               After winning lastwinner_max_games the\n                               user is ignored for the next game.  Can\n                               be controlled with !restrict win_rows.\n\n   lastwinner_max_games   = 2  Max number of games on is allowed to win\n                               in a row.\n\n\n   overrun_protection     = yes\n                               don't accept anwers from new players\n                               after overrunlimit points have been\n                               reached by at least one player (yes/no)\n\n   Things which affect the gameplay and script behaviour (timers and\n   such).  You normally don't want to change these:\n   --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Don't change things here too often, since some affect the allstars\n   score calculation!\n\n   maxranklines     = 25   maximum number of rank or allstarslines\n                           which will ever be shown.  Don't set this\n                           too high, since it blocks all other output\n                           by msg such as help and stuff.\n\n   tipcycle         = 5    number of automatic tips generated\n\n   winscore         = 40   score to win the game\n\n   askdelay         = 15   Delay in seconds between solution and next\n                           question.\n\n   tipdelay         = 30   Delay in seconds between tips.  After the\n                           tip list is printed completely and another\n                           $tipdelay period, the question will be\n                           solved automatically.\n\n\n   System features which you probably don't want to change:\n   --------------------------------------------------------\n\n   userqbufferlength  = 5  Number of user questions scheduled max\n\n   quizloglevel       = 1  Loglevel the script logs it's stuff to.\n\n   useractivetime     = 240 Seconds a user must have said something to\n                           be considered active (so he gets counted\n                           in !revolt code)\n\n\n6. Supplemental tools\n---------------------\n\nThis section describes the supplemental tools found below the\ndirectory named supplemental.\n\n6.1. setup.pl -- set some variables in provided config and moxtools\n----\n\nThis perl script sets some variables mentioned in INSTALL for you.  It\nshould work with a modified config file (if you changed values), but\nprobably will fail if you added a list of servers.  Nevertheless, you\ncan use it with the config files which come with MoxQuizz.\n\n6.2. allstars.pl -- prettyprint the allstars table for MoxQuizz\n----\n\nTo support your quizchannel, allstars.pl prettyprints your allstars\nfile as a ASCII table or as a HTML table.  Invoke with --help to get a\nlist of commands and parameters.\n\n\n7. Future thoughts\n------------------\n\nHere is a small roadmap:\n\n   - team code\n   - tipmode to mix generated and given tips\n   - game styles, like most scores in 30 minutes and such\n\n\n8.

If you've tried it, let me know. :)\n\nEverything except \"bind evnt - init-server init_serv\" \nshould work on 1.5.x\n\nIf you are still using 1.4.x or earlier, \nmaybe it's time to upgrade it??\n\n\nSETTING UP EDDIE42\n------------------\n\n1. Edit eddie.conf, more info on this is included in that file.\n   You MUST edit this file or your bot will not work.\n    (You may also wish to edit parts of eddie2.tcl)\n2. Move eddie2.tcl, insult.tcl, and eddie.conf to your\n    eggdrop/scripts directory (You also need to move greeter.tcl\n    if you intend to use advanced greeting)\n3. Move Techie.sg to the directory you specified in $quotedir\n    (NB. This file is only need by the !quote command)\n4. Move 8ball.txt to the same directory as your executable\n    eggdrop file\n5. Move eddie.help to your eggdrop/help directory\n6. Add the following lines to your eggdrop config file:\n\tsource scripts/eddie.conf\n\tsource scripts/eddie2.tcl\n\tsource scripts/insult.tcl\n        loadhelp eddie.help\n7. Restart your bot. :)\n\n\nCHANNEL COMMANDS\n----------------\n!version, !uptime, !time <zone>, !8ball, !whack <nick>, !calc, !op <nick>,\n!seanmode, !list, !eddie, !giveme <item>, !giveto <item> <nick>, !status,\n!pi <d.p.>, !lock <off/on>, !quote, !poll <results/yes/no>, !random <max>,\n!ping <nick>, !sms <alias> <message>, !help, !whoami, !forcebans, !unlock,\n!voice <nick>, !url <name>, @invite, !devoice <nick>, !flags <handle>\n\n\nPARTYLINE COMMANDS\n------------------\n.auth, .action <channel> <text>, .broadcast <message>, .hand2nick <handle>,\n.join <channel>, .kill <handle> [reason], .locktopic <channel>,\n.limit <on/off/check/status/$n>, .part <channel>, .poll <question>,\n.poll <on/off/reset>, .seanmode <on/off/status>, .sms <list>,\n.unlocktopic <channel>, .urls\n(Use .help to see what standard eggdrop commands you can use)\n\n\nQUERY COMMANDS\n--------------\ndecrypt <text>, encrypt <text>, poll <yes/no>, asl\n(NB. Other standard eggdrop are available via a query)\n\n\nTIPS\n----\n* Using  !help me  will just show you the list of commands, rather than\n  showing the whole channel.\n* !resetbans is the same as doing .resetbans on the partyline.\n  Try  .help resetbans  on the partline for help on what it actually does.\n* You are free to edit or delete lines from 8ball.txt using a simple text\n  editor.  ;)\n* On the partyline, .broadcast will send a message to all the channels,\n  but .banner will send a message to everyone on the partyline.\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n-------------------\nIf you have any problems with setting up or running this script, please\ndon't hesitate to contact me. I can either be via e-mail \n(jamie@softham.co.uk) or via ICQ (32682531).\n\nThe eddie42 project site is located at\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/eddie42/\nFrom the project site you can download the \nlatest version, submit bug reports,\nrequest new features, etc.\n\nHave a lot of fun :)\n\n - Jamie 'Wonko' Cheetham <jamie@softham.co.uk>\n"

Or maybe you did, but the management costs\ntoo much time and work and is very complicated? \n\nNow here's your answer. Simply download this script, configure it and an\neasy chat session is all there's left. Users register with just one\ncommand, which adds their nick+uhost to a file. When you're ready to\nhave people ask the celebrity a question you moderate the chan (+m)\nand type /msg botname dovoice. It will give voice (+v) to the first 2\npersons in the list, who can then ask their question. When they're done\n(or when you think it's enough :P) you do the 'dovoice' command again and\nthe next 2 persons will be given +v (the first 2 will be devoiced first,\ndon't worry). How can it be easier than that? \n\nExtra features include:\n- no double registration (script checks nick and uhost)\n- people can see when it's their turn\n    (list of nicknames can be made public)\n- timed 'onjoin' notice, to give instructions about the\n    registration progress\n- timed registration - you set the time when people should\n    be able to register\n- no stress anymore! :) (uh, who is next to be voiced? he/she\n    already had a turn?)\n- easy commands - even people who've never been on irc know\n    how to use this :)\n\n\nWell, that's about it. Don't be frightened by the many options.\nMost of them are self-explanatory. If you have any questions or comments\n(you used my script and need to shed some tears of gratitude :P)\nfeel free to contact me at l.keijser@chello.nl\n\nHave fun!\n\n\nErrtu - Nov 2003\n"

Description\n2. Installation\n3. Usage\n4. Issues\n5. History\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Description\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere are probably several different variations of this game \nto be found on IRC. This is my variation.\n\nThe game starts when the bot generates a string of letters \n(the ACRO), from which players must try to make a meaningful \nphrase. For example if the ACRO generated is \"MTAGR\", a \nmeaningful phrase could be \"man this acro game rocks\". \nPlayers are given a limited period in which to submit a \nphrase, whereafter the bot will read all the submissions, \nand players will have the opportuniy to vote for the phrase \nthey think is best. A player receives 1 point for every \nvote his/her phrase receives. After the voting time expires, \nthe bot read the scores and the next round begins. After a \npre-determined number of rounds the game ends and the total \nscore for each player is tallied.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInstallation is pretty straightforward:\n - edit the acro.tcl file to your liking \n - put the acro.tcl file somewhere where your bot can get to \n   it\n - make sure you are loading alltools.tcl (1.6 or higher)\n   before loading acro.tcl\n - add a 'source /path/to/scripts/acro.tcl' line to your \n   bot's config file\n - rehash your bot (you should see a message saying that \n   acro.tcl has been loaded or a message saying that it has \n   not been loaded and a reason why).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Usage\n~~~~~~~~\n\nPlaying the game is simple:\n - join the channel you specified for the game to run on\n - type the start command (default is '!acro')\n - the bot generates a random string of letters\n - players then have a fixed amount of time in which to\n   give their phrase, using the /msg botnick acro command\n - after the time runs out, the phrases will be read to the\n   channel and then channel members can vote for their\n   favourite using the /msg botnick vote command\n - after the voting time runs out, the bot tallies the votes\n   and reads the scores for that round and a new round\n   begins\n\nThe game runs for a specified number of rounds (default 10),\nafter which the grand totals for the game are tallied and\nread to the channel and a new game may be started.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Issues\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The method used to track who has played/votedalready is\n  not perfect. The way I've done it is to record a user's\n  ident@hostname when they play/vote to ensure they only\n  do so once in a round. It is possible that two people on\n  the channel using some forms of internet connection\n  sharing will have identical ident@hostname's, in which\n  case only one of them will be able to play.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5. History\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n### 14 Apr 2002\t v1.0.1 ###\n* Fixed stupid bug which prevented the game from working.\n\n\n### 12 Apr 2002\t v1.0.0 ###\n* Cleaned up the files and released it. The script is\n  nowhere near as polished as it should be, but what\n  the hell... experience has taught me that people\n  will tell me what they want.\n\n\n### ? ??? 2001\t v0.0.0 ###\n* The game was originally written in approximately 8\n  hours and never released.\n\nEOF\n"

And the only one\nfloating around at that time.\n\nPlease note that this is NOT copied code but written completely from\nSCRATCH! If you think otherwise, take a look at Nerf's code and I\ndare you to try to copy that :P\n\nAnywho, the acro game is pretty simple. One person types !acro to\nstart the game and then everybody (minimum 3 players) try to make a\nword with the letters that the bot gives you. For exaple 'RTFM'  you\n/msg bot Read The Fscking Manual!  Commas, dots, numbers, everything\nis tolerated as long as you begin the word with the correct letter.\nAfter each round people can vote for the best acro made.\nIt sounds stupid and simple but it's alot of fun .. trust me ;)\n\n\nInstallation:\n=============\n\nSimply untar/ungzip the tgz in your scripts dir (~/eggdrop/scripts/)\nThen move letters.acro file to your eggdrop root dir (~/eggdrop/)\nAdd this line to your .conf file:   source scripts/be-acro.tcl\nAnd you're ready to run.\n\nEnable the script for each chan you want it running in.\nI advise you pick only 1 chan, else the script will fuckup when you\nrun 2 games in 2 different chans at the same time.\nEnable it in dcc with  .chanset #channelname +be-acro\n\n\nList of commands:\n=================\n\n\n!acro <num> \tstarts acro, winner is the first that reaches <num>\n\t\tpoints. Defaults to 30\n\n!acrohelp\tget info about the game\n\n!stopacro\tallows +o users to stop the game and delete scores\n                for the current game\n\n!pauseacro\tstops the game but keeps current scores\n\n!reset\t\tresets scores for the current game\n\n!hiscores\tdisplayes acro alltime top3\n\n!acrohelp\tshows a short info about ACRO in privmsg\n\n\nWeighted letter system:\n=======================\n\nNow this is something really unique.\nLet's say you want acros that start with an S, but the letter S\nshould not appear more than, let's say, the letter T.\nThis is what the letter weighted system is all about.\nIt comes with a standard file (letters.acro) which we use and is\n(i think) perfect.\nBut ofcourse, feel free to modify it using these commands:\n\n\n!howprob <letter>\treturns the probability for one specific \n\t\t\tletter to be chosen in an acro\n\n!useless <letter>\tdecreases the probability for the letter\n\t\t\tto be chosen in an acro\n\n!usemore <letter>\tincreases the probability for the letter\n\t\t\tto be chosen in an acro\n\n\n\n\nMore Features:   (and other stuff)\n==============\n\n\n* You can define the nicknames (case insensitive) of bots or people\n  who will never play acro. Bot checks for a minimum of 3 players &\n  skips these nicks in counting (eg: X / W).  autoskips botnick.\n  Seperate with spaces, eg.: \"X ooga Errtu\"\n\n\n* Have you ever submitted an acro and thought \"Crap, i know a much \n  better one!\" ?  Yeah, so did we :P  So that's why there's this:\n  /msg bot delacro   Which will delete your submitted acro and lets\n  you make a better one.\n\n* Nerf's acro.tcl didn't count on alot of players with the time.\n  This tcl does. If there are more players who submit something,\n  you get more time to vote. If the acro is 4 chars, you get less\n  time to submit something than when it's 8 chars long.\n  Maximum length can also be defined btw.\n  And when everybody has voted, the game automaticly continues\n  so you don't have to wait for nothing.\n\n* Topics for acro. Can also be easily modified and/or turned off.\n\n* Keeps all-time hiscores.\n\n* It's damn stable (we played lots of games without a crash :P)\n\n* I dunno any more features. Prolly i forgot some, but you'll have\n  to find them out for yourself.\n  Lemme know though if you got a new feature suggestion\n  or a bug report:  ooga@ooga.no-ip.org   thanks :)\n\n\n\nErrtu\n\n\n(Errtu's Real Radical Tcl Underground (see, i suck at the game :P))\n"

Feel free to e-mail me at nerfbendr@hotmail.com\nif there's any questions,complaints or comments!\nAlso remember to visit my website at http://nerfbendr.cjb.net to\nsee how my other channelgames for Eggdrops are coming along! 8)\n\nRules Of Play: \n==============\nGameplay is simple...the triviabot displays a question and everyone\nhas a certain number of seconds to guess the answer...the first person\nto guess properly gets the points!\nBelow are only *SOME* of the features inherent to Triviabot v6.0:\n\nFeatures:\n=========\n- Stats kept track of a player include: daily, weekly, monthly and yearly\n  scores so far, the highest number of times in a row they've won, their\n  fastest time they got an answer and how many times they've matched their\n  fastest answer time! \n- View the top 10 scores of ANY day, week, month or year! \n- Completely configurable settings so that your trivia channel *WON'T*\n  play like everyone else's channel that uses the bot! \n- All of the triviabot settings are held in a seperate config file so\n  any and all updates of the triviabot script won't require you to\n  re-configure your triviabot...just replace the triviabot tcl in your bot\n  and off you go! \n- All critical commands now use hostmasks so people can't just take\n  your nick and 'mess' with your bot! \n- Auto and Manual FTP ability to send text and web scores to your website!\n- Hints can now be enabled, disabled, set to either a certain number of\n  letters hint based on a minimum-to-maximum setting in the config file,\n  or give out a certain percentage of letters in the answer as the hint!\n  (So 50% of the answer can be displayed for a hint, this way whether\n  it's a 4 or 20 letter answer, the hint is fair!) \n- Players that request the next question can't use the !hint command or\n  make any more guesses on the question they wanted skipped in order to\n  be fair to all the 'non-quitters'! ;) \n- Already Asked Trivia Tracking Code can track all your trivia without\n  any cpu hogging of the bot! \n- A ScrambleBot has been integrated into the Triviabot and gameplay\n  can be either pure trivia, pure scramble, or a mix of both\n  (Totally configurable!) \n- The bot will accept multiple answers to a question if your trivia banks\n  have more than one answer to a question! \n- The bot can use a form of fuzzy logic to determine if a guess is close\n  enough to an actual answer to warrant a win!\n  (Experimental...you've been warned!) \n- Bonus points can be given for players on a winning streak for every\n  x questions in a row they get! \n- Bonus point trivia can be enabled - same with bonus point scrambles! \n- Hint modes during trivia include Letter Hints, Scramble Hints\n  (Trivia mode only) and Reverse Hints! \n- If you upgrade from a previous version to this one there should be none\n  or minimal score loss of your players!\n  (But you can easily use the transfer and adjust commands to fix them!) 8)\n\n***NOTE: THE CONFIG FILE AS OF v5.9 IS NEW!!! YOU *MUST* USE THE NEW\nCONFIG FILE REGARDLESS OF A PREVIOUS VERSION YOU MAY USE...EVERYTHING\nELSE SHOULD BE FINE!*** \n...the list can go on to cover many more features in the triviabot,\nbut why waste your time in reading it here when you can experience them\nall yourself live... \n\nEnjoy!\nSincerely,\nNerfbendr! 8)\n"

My mission was to create a\nquote script suitable to my own needs, and possibly others who have\nencountered the same problem.\n\nI took the best script I could find at the time, Koloth's Quote\nScript and chopped it up and rewrote things for speed, effeciency,\nand security. Noble by thine cause, it was a daunting task\n(at least for me). After getting the basics working well and\nremoving the security problems, I left the script alone for a\nlong time. Every now and then I would slap on a new feature, squash\na bug or two but nothing really substantial. Also during that time\nperiod between my initial public release and 3.xx's, I received\nnumerous requests for a searching feature.\n\nThis, my friends was my hardest task to accomplish. I created many\nworking search procedures, but they were slow and handled the\nresults horribly. Just recently (past few days), it dawned on me:\nI could use grep to search and have it produce workable results.\nThis was a wonderful development in Quote TCL's history, because\nit beat the Hell out of any search procedures I wrote in TCL.\nIt was extremely fast, simple, and could be used to generate a file\nwith the results. The results file comes complete with line numbers\nand the quotes themselves. This may sound like it creates a bunch\nof text files on your shell and will eat up your quota quickly, but\nI cleverly came up with a solution: remove the file after DCC\nsending it to the user.\n\nSo, the script has nearly everything anyone could want. It's got\nadding, deleting, searching, selecting, random selection, display\nof the last quote added, quote totals, script request,\nfile request, help file sending,  flood protection and all of\nthose commands available in channels/messages/DCC chat (save file\nrequest binds). Certain commands are not available in DCC chat\nbecause of obvious reasons of course. In channel and private\nmessage commands are all protected by the awesome flood protection\npower of the BSeen script, so you need not worry about pesky\nflooders. Future features for the quote script may be things such\nas auto backup of the quote storage file, allowing only public or\nmessage commands, easy customization of how the script displays\nyour quotes, automatic e-mailing of the quote file to the\nadministrator, and allowing the public commands in only specified\nchannels. Don't expect these anytime soon, however. I am very lazy\nand it takes a lot for me to get into writing code.\nEnjoy the script you have now, I put a lot of effort into it. :)\n\n----\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n----\n\nTo install, simply follow these instructions below:\n\n(1) Extract the tarball (quote_tcl-x.xx.tar.gz) to your home\ndirectory. (Yay! You're one step closer to finishing the\ninstallation if you're reading this!)\n\n(2) Change directory to quote_tcl-x.xx and use your favorite UNIX\neditor to tailor quote_tcl-x.xx.tcl to your needs.\nDescriptions for the settings are inside the script already; no\nneed to fret. Complete the process by saving your\nchanges and exiting.\n\n(3) Once you're done editing the TCL file, copy the script AND the\ntarball to your bots scripts/ directory. It is REQUIRED that the\ntar.gz be in your scripts directory, or else !getscript will fail! \n\n(4) After copying those two files, place quote.txt and\nquote_help.txt in your bot's root directory (the place where you\nstart your eggdrop from).\nIf this is not done, the script is useless.\n\n(5) Finally, again fire up your favorite editor and open up your\nEggdrop's configuration file. At the bottom in the scripts section,\nadd \"source scripts/quote_tcl-x.xx.tcl\" (omit the quotes) to\nthe list. Save your changes and exit.\n\n(6) When all above is done, complete the process by DCC chatting\nor telnet'ing your bot and rehasing it. The script\nshould load and work like a dream! Enjoy it!\n\n----\nCONTACTING THE AUTHOR\n----\n\nHave any questions, bug reports, comments, or flames you'd like me\nto hear? Feel free to contact me in any way you wish, I'd love to\nhear your opinion on my script, good or bad, feature request or\nbug report.\nI am on EFNet in #zsnesboard as (normally) [stig] or [st1gg0r].\nMessage me your thoughts and if I'm around, I'll get back to you.\nIf you prefer to contact me via email, stigmata@hvc.rr.com is my\nemail address.

ANY MAILS THAT ARE ANSWERED\n       IN THIS FILE WILL BE IGNORED. BE WARNED. I DO NOT HAVE\n       TOLERANCE FOR THE LAZY.\n\n\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n 2. Description:\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n This is a TCL to turn your bot into an artificially intelligent\n chatterbot.\n\n This is done via communication with a web engine (which does all\n of the real work) which is located at http://www.alicebot.org\n (not just alicebot.org anymore, since 1.1.0, other alice-engines\n  are now used as well, depending on user's choice.)\n Since v1.2.0, the user may choose to use the console line \n program instead of the web interfacing (which can be obtained\n from http://hippie.sf.net).\n\n On a side note, the communication with web engines can be thought\n of as using your eggdrop bot as a web browser, it is no different\n then if one was actually at the webpage with IE, Netscape, or such.\n There is simply a bit more interpretation done by this script\n to make the content actually viewable for the medium (IRC) it is\n being used on.\n\n \n =-=-=-=--=-=-=-=\n 3. Requirements:\n =-=-=-=--=-=-=-=\n\n 1) Eggdrop1.1.5-Eggdrop1.6.x\n 2) egghttp.tcl v1.0.3 or higher (TO BE LOADED BEFORE THIS SCRIPT!!)\n    -OR- bgexec.tcl v1.1 or higher if using Hippie command line\n    interface\n\n =-=-=-=--=-=-=-=\n 4. Installation:\n =-=-=-=--=-=-=-=\n\n Place script in your scripts directory\n Edit the Configuration options at the top of the script\n Add the line: source scripts/alice.tcl to your eggdrop config\n   (See Note)\n Note: !! _AFTER_ THE LINE THAT LOADS EGGHTTP.TCL or BGEXEC.TCL !!\n Done.\n\n\n =-=-=-=-=\n 5. Usage:\n =-=-=-=-=\n\n 1) Message the bot and start conversing with it ..or..\n 2) Say the bot's name in a (defined) channel along with some text\n    and converse away from there\n 3) Depending on configuration, bot's name may or may not be\n    required at all times to get a response from it in channel.\n 4) To have the bot stop talking to you in channel, tell it to\n    \"be quiet\", or \"shut up\", or something along those lines.\n      (seriously)\n\n\n =-=-=-=-=-=\n 6. History:\n =-=-=-=-=-=\n (3/2/04)/v1.4.0   - Fixed a bug with timer calls\n                   - Fixed communication with all of the\n                     pre-programmed alice_engines\n                   - Added alice_ignoreprivate variable to stop the\n\t\t     bot from responding to messages that start with\n                     words defined in this variable\n                   - Added alice_ignorepublic variable to stop the\n                     bot from responding to channel text that start\n\t\t     with words defined in this variable\n                   - Added runabot.com as an alice_engine, which\n\t\t     uses AOL Instant messanger AI Bots\n                   - Added variable alice_relaypriv, which will\n\t\t     display to the partyline what the bot is\n                     saying to a user in private chat\n                   - Other small fixes\n\n (6/1/03)/v1.3.0   - Fixed communication with alice_engine's 0,3,4\n                   - Added pandorabot's engine, which users can use\n                     to setup and configure their own server engine\n\t\t     (www.pandorabots.com -> MUST use the included\n                     template html file though!)\n                   - Added dcc command '.flushcookies' to expunge\n                     engine cookies for all stored users.\n\n (10/14/02)/v1.2.3 - Fixed communication with alice_engine #4 again\n                     (hippie.sourceforge.net). (Added option to\n                     manually set url variable for this engine if\n\t\t     url changes)\n                   - Added info about using Hippie command line\n                     interface to the FAQ section of this file\n                     (Thanks to Spider)\n\n (10/7/02)/v1.2.2  - Fixed communication with alice_engine #4\n                     (now: lol.afraid.org)\n                   - Moved engine #'s around a bit to facilitate\n\t\t     an addition\n                   - Added option to have bot communicate with your\n\t\t     own Hippie CGI interface\n\n (9/20/02)/v1.2.1  - Fixed communication with alice_engine #4\n                     (neodave.civ.pl)\n                   - Fixed problem with talking to bots with\n                     special characters in their nicks in channels\n\n (9/16/02)/v1.2.0  - The Hippie (Program-C) Alice project has been\n                     brought up to AIML 1.x specification, so this\n                     script now allows you to use the hippie\n                     command line interpretter instead of having to\n                     communicate over the web if you don't wish to,\n                     you can grab Hippie from\n\t\t     http://hippie.sourceforge.net\n                     New variables related to usage of hippie\n                     command line executable: alice_hippie_path ,\n\t\t     alice_hippie_inipath , alice_hippie_logpath\n                     There is an irc_alice.tcl that can be used\n                     with Hippie, but it lacks the features that\n\t\t     this alice.tcl provides.\n                     Note: Usage of Hippie command line executable\n                           means that alice.tcl does NOT require\n                           egghttp.tcl, however, bgexec.tcl IS\n                           needed to communicate with the program\n\t\t\t   in non-blocking mode.  This can be\n\t\t\t   obtained from the same location as\n                           egghttp.tcl: www.TCLScript.com\n                   - Added new channel flag for eggdrop versions\n\t\t     1.5.x and higher: +/-alice, which means the\n                     bot will respond to people who mention its\n                     name in +alice channels\n\t\t     (.chanset #channel +alice  or\n                      .chanset #channel -alice  to turn off)\n                   - Added logging of conversations with bot:\n                     New variables: alice_logging ,\n\t\t                    alice_log_path\n                   - Added neodave.civ.pl (Hippie) alice engine\n\t\t     server\n                   - Added a program E (Phillip) alice engine\n\t\t     server\n                   - Removed the harvard sofia alice engine\n                   - Fixed communication with server 0\n\t\t     (alicebot.org)\n\n (7/24/02)/v1.1.4  - Changed egghttp version requirement to v1.0.3\n                     as there was a problem if you specified your\n                     own programD server and were using a TCL \n                     version higher than 8.0\n                   - Updated FAQ a bit\n\n (7/7/02)/v1.1.3   - Fixed output replies from the Jaczone engine\n\n (7/1/02)/v1.1.2   - Strip mIRC codes before sending text to server\n                     (Thanks to Wcc for the short regsub line to\n\t\t      do so)\n\n (6/27/02)/v1.1.1  - Alice-Engine #0 (alicebot.org) should work\n                     again (until they change something else\n\t\t     anyways...)\n                   - Added a small bit of text to the FAQ\n\n (6/18/02)/v1.1.0  - New features.. skipped releasing 1.0.4 to\n                     public\n                   - Can now choose which site to use as its\n\t\t     alice-engine\n                   - Two new variable settings:\n                     1) alice_respondwithnick -> whether or not to\n                          always respond with a user's nick\n                     2) alice_respondrequirenick -> whether or not\n                          bot's nick is always required to be said\n                          for it to respond to a user.\n                   - Bit more documentation included now (FAQ)\n\n (6/14/02)/v1.0.4  - Ok, I lied, no new features this version...\n                   - Let's ignore msg commands (ie. passwords)\n                   - Bug fix.. rogue 'return' statement outside\n\t\t     of proc\n\n (6/13/02)/v1.0.3  - Fixed up strip_html procedure\n                     (Next release should include new features)\n\n (5/22/02)/v1.0.2  - Fixed problem with &amp; html code\n                   - Fixed a caching cookie problem\n\n (5/14/02)/v1.0.1  - Fixed typo for required egghttp.tcl\n                     version (1.0.0)\n                   - Let's not let the bot have a conversation\n\t\t     with itself or other bots for that matter\n                   - Update a user's cookies timestamp so they\n                     won't be expired for not being used\n\n (5/13/02)/v1.0.0  - Initial Release\n\n\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n 7. Variable Settings:\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n alice_cookiesfile\n - File to save alice-engine web cookies to\n\n alice_cookiesexpire\n - Define the number of days of inactivity at which cookies\n   will expire\n\n alice_respondpriv\n - Allows or disallows your bot from responding to private\n   messages (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n\n alice_respondchan\n - Allows or disallows your bot from responding to public\n   channel messages when its nick is mentioned (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n\n alice_respondrequirenick\n - If alice_respondchan is set to 1, this will require (or not\n   require) that the bot's nick be mentioned in all lines of a\n   conversation by a user after the initial conversation\n   engagement. (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n\n alice_respondwithnick\n - If alice_respondchan is set to 1, to prevent confusion, you may\n   turn this feature on, to have the bot respond with the user's\n   nick that it is speaking to. (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n\n alice_channels\n - If alice_respondchan is set to 1, define the channels that the\n   bot will engage conversations in. Separate multiple channels\n   with a space, or use \"*\" for all channels.\n\n alice_timeoutchat\n - If alice_respondchan is set to 1, define the number of minutes\n   that the bot will wait for user's text in a channel after the\n   first contact has been made, before giving up on the\n   conversation.\n\n alice_logging\n - If alice_logging is set to 1, logs will be kept of\n   conversations with your bot in a location you specify\n   in the next variable setting.\n\n alice_log_path\n - If alice_logging is set to 1, set this variable to the location\n   of where you want to store the log files.  Note: The path must\n   already exist.  Also, you must place the trailing / at the end.\n\n alice_engine\n - Define the engine to use to power the bot's responses\n   This list is:\n   0 = www.alicebot.org       (Alice)\n   1 = www.agentruby.com      (Ruby)\n   2 = www.tfxsoft.com        (A program-E server)\n   3 = www.jaczone.com        (Cyber-Ivar)\n   4 = your own Aine CGI server\n   5 = Your own program-D Alice Server\n   6 = Your own program-C CGI (Hippie CGI) Alice Server\n   7 = Your own actual Hippie program-C Alice command line\n       interface\n   8 = Your own engine hosted at www.pandorabots.com\n   9 = A runabot.com AOL Instant Messenger bot web interface\n       (www.runabot.com)\n\n   For #4, you may download the software for such a server from\n   http://www.bitesizeinc.net/index.php/ainebot.html\n   As for setting up the cgi script, I leave that to you\n   and the docs that come with the software you download.\n   I did NOT write it, so do NOT contact me for help with it.\n\n   For #5, you may download the software for such a server from\n   http://www.alicebot.org, and while it does provide an IRC client\n   as well as the web server, the IRC client lacks many features of\n   a typical eggdrop, thus not making it very useful.\n   As for setting up the server if you choose #5, I leave that to\n   you and the docs that come with the software you download. I\n   did NOT write it, so do NOT contact me for help with that.\n\n   For #6 and #7, you may download the software for the hippie\n   command line engine from http://hippie.sourceforge.net, and\n   while it may or may not come with a file called irc_alice.tcl\n   to use with eggdrop, it lacks the features that this script\n   provides. As for installing the software, read the documentation\n   that comes with Hippie.  If you still have problems setting\n   Hippie up, do NOT contact me, as I did not write the Hippie\n   software.\n   \n   For #8, you may sign up for a free account to host your engine\n   at http://www.pandorabots.com.  However, to allow it to work\n   with this script, you will have to configure your engine there\n   to use the included alice.html file that came with this\n   alice.tcl distribution.  I leave it up to you to figure out\n   how to do this. (It's not that hard, just read the configuration\n   pages).\n\n   For #9, you may sign up and download their software so that\n   alice.tcl can communicate with your AI AOL bot through the\n   web.  You will then need to provide the url to the alice_url\n   variable by first looking at the html source for your bot's\n   html chat page\n      http://www.runabot.com/cgi-bin/webcom/caim?botname=(your bot)\n   and finding a url that starts with:\n      http://www.runabot.com/perl/webcaim/(numbers here)\n   You must then add on to the end of that the following:\n      &botname=(your bot)\n\n alice_url\n - If you choose #4, #5, #6, #8, or #9 for the alice_engine, then\n   enter the url to where you set it up, for this variable.\n\n alice_hippie_path\n - If you choose #7 for the alice_engine, then enter the path on\n   your shell to where you have installed the Hippie command line\n   program.\n\n alice_hippie_inipath\n - If you choose #7 for the alice_engine, then enter the path on\n   your shell to where the alice.ini file is located after you\n   have installed Hippie.\n\n alice_hippie_logpath\n - If you choose #7 for the alice_engine, then enter the path on\n   your shell to the location where the Hippie engine stores data\n   on users it converses with.\n   Note: You must enter the trailing / at the end.\n \n alice_ignoreprivate\n - Have the bot ignore private messages that start with the words\n   defined in this variable\n\n alice_ignorepublic\n - Have the bot ignore public chat that starts with the words\n   defined in this variable\n\n alice_relaypriv\n - Relay the responses the bot sends to a user in private messages\n   to the partyline\n\n =-=-=-=\n 8. FAQ:\n =-=-=-=\n\n 1) Q: Where can I download egghttp.tcl or bgexec.tcl?\n    A: http://www.TCLScript.com -- in the projects section\n\n 2) Q: Why don't I get any response from my bot when I message it?\n    A: 1) You didn't load egghttp.tcl BEFORE loading alice.tcl in\n          your eggdrop config file\n       2) The alice-engine you are using may be down. Try choosing\n          another engine to power your bot's responses.\n          (variable setting: alice_engine)\n       3) The box your bot is on may be behind a firewall or router\n          In which case, you might not be able to use alice.tcl\n          with your bot, sorry.\n       If the box your bot is running on is behind a\n       firewall/router, \n       DO NOT ASK ME FOR HELP WITH IT!\n     \n 3) Q: Why do I keep getting 'I am restarting. Just a minute' as a\n       response?\n    A: Problems with the website that powers the script.\n       This is beyond my control, so deal with it.\n\n 4) Q: How do I set up my own alice-engine web server?\n    A: Go to http://www.alicebot.org and read everything there and\n       download the software from there as well.  Beyond that,\n       I can not help you.  Look at the contact information in the\n       software you download from there if you need assistance.\n       Do NOT email -me- asking to help you set it up.\n\n 5) Q: I'm having problems using alice.tcl with the hippie command\n       line interface, any suggestions?\n    A: Apparently, hippie will crash if the executable,logs,data\n       files are not relative to the eggdrop path itself, so try\n       putting (or installing) the hippie files in the eggdrop\n       directory.\n\n 6) Q: I'm using engine #4 (hippie.sourceforge.net) and it doesn't\n       seem to be working?\n    A: Try visitting http://hippie.sourceforge.net and find the\n       link to the hippie web interface, and try setting the\n       alice_url variable to this in the configuration section of\n       the script. If there is still a problem, you will have to\n       wait for an updated release of alice.tcl.\n\n 7) Q: I can message my bot and it will respond, but when I try to\n       talk to it in a channel, it doesn't respond.\n    A: You did NOT read what the comments above the settings stated\n       They stated: \"If using eggdrop1.5.x or higher, then use\n       .chanset #channel +alice , do NOT set the channels in\n       this variable\".  Enough said.\n\n 8) Q: I've switched engines, and now the bot won't respond, what\n       should I do?\n    A: First, try using the partyline command: .flushcookies to\n       clear out all stored cookies for users associated with the\n       old engine. If that doesn't work, then the engine you have\n       switched to probably isn't working, in which case,\n       change to another engine.\n\n 9) Q: I think I have found a bug that isn't addressed here, what\n       should I do?\n    A: First, check the website (www.TCLScript.com) for the latest\n       version, and also check the news box on the main page.\n       If the problem still persists and you are positive it isn't\n       addressed in any of the formentioned locations,\n       then you may e-mail me.\n\n\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n 9. Greetings:\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n - Alybe, Auriga, BarkerJr, guppy, hellios, jam, MC_8, mikee,\n   MORA, Mosher, oiad, Pixelz, PPSlim, prefect, raeky, simon,\n   Tala, user, Wcc\n\n\n WARNING: Again, DO NOT EMAIL ME IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE ENTIRE\n          README FILE. ANY QUESTIONS ASKED THAT ARE ANSWERED ABOVE\n          WILL BE IGNORED.  I HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR THE LAZY.\n\t  ENJOY.\n"

Setting \"time\" to 0 will make\n       the ban permanent. The reason is set to the \"reason\"\n       specified in the command.\n\n!ipban - The ban command does not allow you to put ip bans.\n         This command does that for you. The command can be\n         used exactly like !ban i.e.\n   !ipban n!u@ip\n   !ipban n!u@ip reason\n   !ipban n!u@ip reason time\n\n!unban - This command helps you to kick someone out of the\n         party line of the bot even without logging in the bot!\n         All you have to do is type:\n   !boot handle - The bot boots \"handle\" out of the party line\n         and sets reason to \"Requested by $nick\" where $nick \n         is the nick of the person who used the command.\n   !boot handle reason - The bot boots \"handle\" out of the\n         party line and sets reason to \"reason\".\n\n!mode - Helps to set certain modes on the channel.\n   Syntax:\n      !mode +mode-mode\n   The mode is applied on the channel it was typed in.\n\n!dcclist - Gives you a summary of what is going on the\n   party line of the bot.  The other options are explained\n   by the bot when you use the command.\n\n!isuser - Tells you if a user is present in the bot userlist.\n   Syntax:\n      !isuser nick\n\n!adduser - This command helps to add a new user to the bot's\n           database.  The command can be used in different ways\n           as shown below:\n   !adduser nick - The \"nick\" specified is added to the bot\n       internal user list with the current hostmask of the\n       user i.e  n!*u@A.B.C.*  with no password.\n   !adduser nick host - The \"nick\" specified is added to the\n       bots userlist with the hostmask \"host\".\n\n!deluser - This command deletes an user from the bots internal\n           user list.  The syntax of the command is:\n   !deluser nick\n\n!chattr - This changes the user flags for a specified user.\n          The flags are in the format <global>|<channel>.\n          The syntax of the command is:\n   !chattr nick flags\n\n!count - Displays the number of users currently in the bots\n         user database. \n   Syntax:\n      !countusers\n\n!botlist - Returns the bots which are currently linked to\n           your eggdrop.\n   Syntax:\n      !botlist\n\n!save - Saves the user and channel files.\n   Syntax:\n      !save\n\n!reload - Reloads the user file discarding any changes since\n          the last save.\n"

(\"home/user/eggdrop/VHostlist.txt\")\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\n-----------Updates 1.0.5------------\n\nI implemented using a separate file to store the vhost list.\n\nI added the ability to add vhosts via \"/msg bot addvhost new.vhost.here\"\n (restricted by adding a special flag to users you want to allow to\n  add vhosts).\n\nI added easy configuration for disabling certain features\n (such as \"/msg bot vhost vhost.here\").\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\n---------------About----------------\n\nI Made this script for my eggdrop because I was tired of having to have\n people msg me to activate my mirc script to get a VHost on my Network.\n\nThis script has 3 ways of giving out vhosts.\n\nFirst is by Message /msg botnick vhost your.vhost.here  or  /msg botnick\n random to get a random vhost from a list in the script. (Can be disabled)\n\nSecond is by Public Command !vhost your.vhost.here or !randomvhost for a\n random vhost from the script list. (Can be disabled)\n\nThird is by Joining a channel (#VHost by default) and the bot will \n randomly assign a vhost.\n\nI also added a message command to force the bot to oper up,\n \"/msg botnick oper\".\n\nYou will need to set some variables in the script like the bot's Oper\n username and password, and the channel if you dont want it to be #VHost\n but that is explained in the script and you will have to read it.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\n ---1.0.4 updates---\nI added an auto-oper on join to the script so you don't have to\n type /msg bot oper anymore.\n\nI have also made the bot auto-op itself in the VHost channel after\n it Opers up incase there are other people in the channel.\n\nThe bot now ignores users for a settable amount of time when they use the\n /msg bot vhost new.vhost.here command, or the /msg bot random command.\n\nI added a public command to get a random vhost by typing !randomvhost\n in any channel the bot is in.\n -----end 1.0.4-----\n\n\nMore Updates to come when I have the time or inspiration.\n\nWell thats about it, Come wisit us at\n Http://www.CoolChat-IRC.org and on irc.p2pchat.net Sometime.\n"

However, this script stands out due to its\n focus on use by bot services as well as with the lengths to which\n we have gone to ensure this script is as secure, stable and\n user-friendly as reasonably possible.  \n\n For those of you familiar with X-Bot, this is the TCL code that\n powers X-Bot however modified and designed for easy use in\n eggdrop/windrop.\n This particular version will be the TCL core for X-Bot 2004.\n\n\nUpdates since Beta #1:\n----------------------\n  - Commands that depended on knowing wheither you were using\n    X-Bot or OTBN.tcl now work properly without crashing the bot.\n\nLegal Stuff:\n------------\n You may be familiar with the OTBN series ILLEGALLY released by\n Bot-Solutions (www.Bot-Solutions.org).  We are the legal owners\n of the OTBN name and therefore are the only party who can legally\n release a script with that name.  The number of security holes\n and bugs in the OTBN.tcl by Bot-Solutions alone should be enough\n reason to move to OTBN.tcl by Overtech Technologies.\n\n\nFor more Information:\n---------------------\n  - This Script's Homepage: http://www.OvertechTechnologies.com/otbn\n  - The X-Bot Homepage: http://www.OvertechTechnologies.com/x-bot\n\n====================================================================\nThis script is (c) 2000-2003 Overtech Technologies\n"

Speeded up some parts and Deleted old\n#    unfinished parts I decided agesnt on. and deleted the debug parts\n#    I used for debuging. Some still exist but most are deleted.\n# 1.23a:      Added a generic Security Function (optional On/Off) When on\n#    Users Must identify to the bot /msg bot identify <pass>.\n#    Do to Many TCL and old script functions I have updated many parts\n#    to the newer settings and Removed old unused functions.\n#    (Bug I found while testing one of my bots out) <fixed>\n#    added command (up) for oping your self.(Stupid me left it out\n#    But its in now!) Added (down) for deoping your self as well.\n#    Fixed a mispelled word in the Topic Lock Section. Befor now Before.\n#    added (op username) and (chattr username flags <optional Chan>).\n# 2.0+switch: Decided on v2.0 Since im rewriting most of the script into a\n#    switch function insted of multi binds and such. The major upgrade is the\n#    switch command.. Makes it run Much faster and easier to do my commands\n#    Added Protective Status Command for servers that support +a..\n#     (option to turn off)\n#    Added new command \"Register\" for registering channels on chanservs.\n#    (Only works on networks with ChanServ).. Added random Password Generator.\n#    Fixed the Topic Lock Findly. added Raw Command binds for whois & whowas.\n#    added extra file for raw binds and commands called raw.tcl Make sure you\n#    have it in your Lightning-Bolt Directory or script wont load..\n#    This realse is a omost total Rewrite and Converted for speed.\n#    Its called beta1 for the reasons I have yet to finish everything I want\n#    in it. the Code for some things are there just not functional yet.\n#    upgraded the user counter for when users join it tells them what visitor\n#    number they are, well now for numbs like \"5123\" it will convert over to \n#    \"5123rd\" and \"5432\" to \"5432nd\" and so on.. you get the idea..\n#    Nothing big just looks beter.. \n# v2.Series.b1: added badword function but not fully finished yet. Version\n#    Name change too. Now you can set forbidden words that users cant use in\n#    channel. it works for each channel. rewrote the NOTE command to be more\n#    user friendly. (still have much work to do on it though, But it works)\n#    Fixed a few text parts displaying wrong text as to also pushing wrong\n#    chattr's to users. (my mistake from copy past after wrighting one section\n#    then past it and forgot to change everything over. it was only for 3 areas\n#    owner/master/autovoice - all works now) Fixed the idle in \"whois/swhois\"\n#    it displayed mins the person idle but not the correct hours/min/secs so on.\n#    now it will display correct format into years weeks days hours mins secs.\n# v2.Series.b2: Fixed a bug in the seen/whois/swhois on the idle time.. now it\n#    displays the correct time format. fixed a chanserv bug now you can use the\n#    config setting for (<channel Name> <Password for channel> and so on.\n#    exp: \"#none changeme #zero lessthen #eggdrop notreal\" you get the idea now.\n#    added \"update\" to check for lastist version of the script. (not fully yet).\n#    fixed a problem in cmd topic it would display { } sometimes on some topics\n#    problem was caused from not converting to a string with the join command..\n#\n#\n#THIS WILL BE THE LAST UPDATE FOR A WHILE I'M REALLY BUSY WORKING ON MY WEBSITE\n#  THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT HELPED ME IN TESTING IN MAKING THIS SCRIPT. I WILL\n# CONTINUE THIS SCRIPT WITHEN A MONTH OR 2 FROM NOW. ALL BUG REPORTS WILL STILL\n#BE EXCEPTED AND FIXED AND RELEASED. BUT ANYTHING NEW OTHER THEN BUG FIXES THAT\n#  ARE REPORTED WILL NOT BE DONE FOR A MONTH OR 2.. THANKS AGAIN FOR EVERYONE\n#    THAT HELPED AND REPORTED ALL BUGS... CYA ALL L8RZ..\n##############################################################################\n# KNOWN BUGS:\n#\n# v2.0: If channel name has weird chars Like \"|\" the badword file creation may\n#   have problems creating the correct file. Also when adding a badword in\n#   chanel the script picks it up as a badword the min you add it. ill fix that.\n#   when you add a word to the badword list for a difrent punishment like\n#   if you already had a word on for kick and add the same word for ban\n#   it will still think kick even if you delete the kick. way around this is to\n#   rehash the bot after deleting the kick and ban word.. then re add it.\n#\n# v2.Series.b1: Bug Reported when using lb topic a missing brace caused it not\n#               to work. Problem has been fixed. Look for fix in v2.series.b2.\n#\n#\n##############################################################################\n# FIXED BUGS:\n#\n# v2.0:  Topic Lock Bug of the changing topic even if the topic was never\n#     changed has been Defeated.. it now checks all channels and topics that\n#     bot is on agenst its vars and if everything checks out it will not change\n#     the topic or it will.. (BUG FIXED) Still need to fix blank line bug.\n#\n##############################################################################\n# TODO: Working on fixng more bugs going to make all passwords used\n#        on this script encrypted and put into a database. Going to add\n#         a Nickindet so your bot can log your nicks in so you dont loose them.\n#         a beter filter for the Note and a public notes for any user to store\n#         notes like a memo. more security Most commands are public im going\n#         add dcc and msg commands to the more secure commands for added\n#          security. Many more things im going to be working on.\n#\n# Date: 07/30/03: Write an option for the Topic Lock to have a set Time Limit\n#                 to expire. Decided to prob make all commands avail with\n#                 msg and dcc but Seprate file. then put in config or main\n#                 script if you want msg and dcc commands avail or one or the\n#                 other, It will save memory and resource that way.\n# Date: 08/29/03: Fix Services Functions (Soo damm lazzy I am) I also\n#            want to add botnet functions like sending commands to one or few\n#            or even all bots on botnet.

It provides an\ninfobot to use on IRC (help) channels.  It acts like a requestable database\nand it's a robust and versatile system.\n\nIssue !dic on a channel for the commands list.\n\n\nfeatures\n========\n\n* database is saved on a text file\n* different or shared database files for each channel\n* timestamps conform to rfc3339 (internet date/time)\n* able to send the database file through DCC\n* support for multiple definitions per key\n* simple database search capabilities\n* simple usage and contribution statistics\n* online search through a set of php scripts\n\n\nconceptual goals\n================\n\n* be stable and fast\n* extensible and maintainable\n\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nTo use dicinfo all the .tcl files should be in the same directory and dic.tcl\nshould be loaded in eggdrop.conf using \"source path/to/dic.tcl\".\n\nOn dic.tcl and dic-cmd.tcl you can specify what should be the flags permitted\nto modify/access the definitions.  These are:\n\nlflag(get) - flag to obtain information\nlflag(cmd) - flag to the other mortals (not quite but...)\n\nlfile(cmm) - common database file for channels\nlfile(cms) - use (1) or not (0) the common database\n\nlfile(max) - # of chars that each definition can be (def. 192)\nlfile(def) - # of definitions that a key can have (def. 10)\n\nBy default all users can obtain information and only +f flagged users can\nadd/erase the keys.  (see the internals of dic-cmd.tcl).  Use the !dic trigger\nto learn more about the arguments and their options.  Documentation is not\nextensive but all the usage is there.\n\n\ndic.dat format\n==============\n\nyyyy-mm-ddThh:nn:ssZ nick unikey long-spaced-description\n\nThe timestamp (the 1st field) on dic.dat conforms to RFC3339.\n(see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)\n\n\nbug reports\n===========\n\nPatches or bug reports should be mailed to <mferra@users.sourceforge.net>.\nSome feedback about the usage and experience with dicinfo is also appreciated.\n\nEnjoy dicinfo\n\n\"The spice must flow.\"  (Baron Harkonnen, Dune)\n"

For this purpose\nthis script utilizes 2 eggdrop bots. The first bot being a channel cycler\nbot to detect spammers, and the second one being an opped bot on the\nchannel to kick out those spammers.\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Purpose of the Script\n2 Description of the Script\n3 How this Script works\n4 Script Requirements\n5 Script Functions and features\n6 Script Setup and Installation\n7 Bug Reports\n8 Credits\n9 Versions\n\n\n:Purpose of the Script:\n\nAt first, I came up with the idea of this script on my own.\nLater onwards with the help of friends and other scripters I turned my idea\ninto reality. An enhanced script of this kind was requested by my friends\nfor their eggdrop bots, to remove unwanted spammers, inviters, advertisers\nfrom their channels. So basically, I developed this script to eliminate any\nkind of spammers lurking around in channels.\n\nAs we know spammer scripts are getting clever day by day, so we should try\nand make these spam detector and remover script better as well.\nSince spammer scripts don't message channel operators/voices now a days so\nmerely 90% of the scripts I have seen on the web have become useless now\nand leave spam undetected. Therefore, I have developed this one of a kind\nscript which can still detect and remove spammers and their spam!\n \n\n:Description of this Script:\n\nSpam bots and drones now a days don't message their spam on the main\nchannel, only in private messages/queries (/MSG) and private notices\n(/NOTICE) to the non-opped and non-voiced users in the channel.\nThis way all most all opped protection bots in the channel are unable to\ndetect this private spam, as these spammer bots and drones are\nmessaging/noticing channel users privately.\n\nWhat this script basically does is that, it utilizes *2* bots;\nOne for the purpose of spam detection and the other for spam elimination.\nOne bot will be a channel cycler bot, cycling the channel detecting for\nspammers which private message it in queries or notices.\nThen, supposing if a spammer is found, it would message another bot (the\nsecond bot), which is opped on the channel, which in return would kick/ban\nthat spammer out of the channel.\nHere is an easy example, if you still are blur:\n\nThis script utilizes *2 spam checker bots*, namely:\n\nOne channel cycler bot (Detects spammers on the channel)\n(This bot continuously cycles the channel to check for spam & is not opped)\n\nAnother opped bot on the channel (Kicks spammers out of the channel)\n(This will be a normal bot and will be opped on the spam detection channel) \n\nAs this script utilizes *2 eggdrop bots*, so both would be using different\nTCL scripts. Hence this TCL package comprises of 2 'TCL Scripts',\neach script being used on one bot only.\n\nOne TCL script will be used for the channel cycler (spam checker) bot\n        (spamdetect.tcl)\nAnother TCL script would be used for the opped channel protection bot \n        (spamkick.tcl)\n\n\n:How this Script works:\n\nThis scripts works in unity with both its subscripts (spamdetect.tcl and\nspamkick.tcl). Both scripts work in coherence with one another proving to\nbe an efficient spam eliminator.\n\nThe working procedure of this script is very simple and is described\nbriefly as follows:\n\nOnce both scripts are set and loaded into both separate bots, first the\nspam checker bot will continuously cycle the channels you have defined for\nit to check to spams and advertisements.\n\nThe cycle timers on the spam cycling checker bot can be set by bot owners\naccording to their needs.\n\nWhen the bot is cycling the channel continuously, spam bots, drones and\ninviter bots will obviously message your cycler bot with spam messages. \n\nNot all messages sent to the cycler bot by users will be recorded as spam\nor invites. There is a certain criteria for matching words in the text of\nthe user, which is defined by the word list to detect if a user is\nspamming or not.\n(wildcards such as \"*\" are accepted in the spam detection word list)\n\nAfter determining if a user is spammer, the cycler bot will record the\nusers info and would pass it onto your opped channel bot. The info details\nmaybe such as the nick and IP Address of the spammer. (The PINS are given\nfor additional security so users are not able to exploit your opped bot,\nsupposing if your cycler bot goes offline, or gets lost in a netsplit)\n\nThen your spam cycler bot, will message your opped bot with the spammers\ninfo (basically relaying the information from one bot to another) for the\nsame channel. \n\nAfter receiving authorization for the info from the cycler bot, your opped\nbot will verify the information and proceed in punishing the user.\nPunishments will be a ban place on the IP Address of the user followed\nby a kick.\n\n\n:Script Requirements:\n\nThis script has been tested to work one eggdrop-1.5.x and higher.\nTCL 8.0 or higher will be required to execute/run this script.\n\nThis script requires *2 eggdrop* bots.\n (each bot would be configured separately)\n\nOne eggdrop bot should be opped on the channel on which you are detecting\nspam from. (It will kick out the spammers from the channel)\n\nThe second eggdrop bot should be cycling the channel where you will be\ndetecting spammers from. (It will be detecting spammers in the channel)\n\nBoth eggdrops should be on the same channel(s) from which you want to\ndetect spam from and also kick out the spammers from.\n (Both work as a team, so they should be on the same channel)\n\nAs you will need to load 2 TCL scripts in two separate eggdrop bots, you\nwill also need 2 free background processes on your shell to load these\neggdrops on.\n\n\n:Script Functions and features:\n\nThis TCL script has complex features as they are sophisticated to setup.\nThis script performs all functions of what normal spam bots on mIRC\nScripts can achieve. Listed below are most of the scripts features\ndescribed briefly:\n\nThis script has a very effective spam detection and removal system, due to\nthe usage of 2 enhanced eggdrop bots. Most likely 98% of private spams,\nadvertisements and invites are removed on channels with the help of\nthis script.\n\nThis script has a fully customizable spam word detection match pattern.\nMatching words in the word list can be added and modified by bot owners\naccording to their needs. (wildcards such as \"*\" are accepted)\n\nThis script detects private messages (/MSG) as well as private notices\n(/NOTICE) making it more effective than others.\n\nIf the spammers are think they are clever and they introduce control codes\ninto their spam messages, thinking that matching words will not match the\nworld list due to the presence of control codes. This script has a control\ncode filter specially for removing all control codes before the text is\nsent for processing and spam detection.\n\nThis script has intelligent channel cycling timers, which can be preferably\ncustomized by bot owners specifically in the delays of joins and parts.\n(Note this script does not have fast rejoin cycles, joining and parting are\nin sequence are a bit delayed so spambots would ignore the cycler bot and\nconsider it as a normal user)\n\nThis script has a multi-channel support, meaning it can be used on more than\none channel. Apart from that, more than one cycler bot can be used.\nPeople having bigger channels filled with spammers can load more cycler bots.\n(using the same configurations for all of the bots in the of the\n spamdetect.tcl)\n\nFor some clever spammers and spam bots, the bot has a random auto talking\nability, with fully customizable word lists to check users for spam, as some\nspammers do not display their spam message on their first message to a user.\n(I added this talking feature to outsmart, those smart spamming/advertising\n scripts)\n\nSuppose if your cycler bots go offline like gets lost in a netsplit, even\nwith NickServ's ENFORCE/KILL option on, people can use the cycler bots nick\nfor 60 seconds and might try to exploit the opped bot with it.\nFor this purpose I have added authorization PIN'S in both bots which users\ncan customize and would help to prevent exploitation.\n\nA spammer report feature has been added in both the opped bot.\nThe spammer report feature will enable any the opped bot to report the\nspammer and spammers info to any 'nick' or '#channel' via /msg or /notice.\nThis report would contain the spammers nick, user host and the spam message\nthrough which the spammer had been spamming from.\n\nAlso added a small kick counter.\nEvery time the bot kicks a spammer it would increase the number of kicks in\nits database. The total number of users kicked by the bot would be shown at\nthe end of each kick message.\n\nUsers can choose between *2 types* of kick messages.\nEither display the random kick message of the script, or choose to display\nthe spam message the user was spamming with, in the kick message.\n(Added on request)\n\nBans enforced by the opped bot are normal channel bans and not sticky\n(global) bans. (I made it this way because the bots global banlist blacklists\nan IP and doesn't let users enter until the ban expires, while some people\nout there might be sitting in cybercafes using same IP addresses which are in\nthe bots banlist, who are not spammers).\n\nThere is an spammer recorder info included in opped bot.\nThe spammers info such as the ip address, nick, user host, channel and the\nspam message is recorded and stored in a file. Later onwards bot owners can\nretrieve the file and can akick/blacklist the ip addresses found in it if\nthey want to keep or they can keep a track of spammers and their spam\nmessages found on the channels their bots are monitoring.\n\nThe are 20 types of bans which can be selected by bot owners with varying\nbanmasks on the spam kicker bot.  These banmasks enforce a greater range of\ncustomizable bans for banning spammers.\n\n\n:Script Setup and Installation:\n\nThis is a complex script, so you need to setup this script in an orderly\nmanner.  If you do not follow these steps properly you will not be able to\nconfigure the script properly and the script might not work. To begin\nconfiguring and setting up the variables on the script refer to the steps\nlisted below:\n\nPLEASE FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS CORRECTLY AND MAKE SURE YOU\nCOMPLETE ALL STEPS PROPERLY, OTHERWISE YOUR BOTS WILL NOT BE SETUP PROPERLY.\n\nAfter downloading the script *PRIVATESPAM.ZIP*, please unzip the file into a\nseparate directory. After unzipping you will have 2 files in your directory\napart from this help file (readme.html).\n   (a) spamdetect.tcl\n   (b) spamkick.tcl\n   (c) readme.html (The file you are currently reading)\n\nAfter you have unzipped the files successfully,\nnow we may need to know which would be used for which bot.\n   SPAMDETECT.TCL  ====> This script will be used by your spam cycler bot.\n   SPAMKICK.TCL    ====> This script will be used by opped spam kicker bot.\n\nAfter you have unzipped the files successfully, now we may begin to configure\neach of the scripts separately. First we would configure and setup the\nvariables on the 'spamdetect.tcl' script.\n\nFor this, please open the file 'SPAMDETECT.TCL' in your Windows NOTEPAD\nor WORDPAD.\n\nAfter you have successfully opened 'spamdetect.tcl' in your notepad.\nPlease scroll down the initial first 10 lines which give an info regarding\nthis script. When you have reached the point with a logo showing this:\n\n     ### Start editing variables from here! ###                            \n\nFrom this point onwards you will be start to setup the variables of the\nscript. There are altogether 18 variable settings to be setup in the\nspamdetect.tcl script. Please make sure you fill all fields correctly and\ndon't leave any field out blank.\n\nThe instructions to fill in each variable are given in comments.\nSo, there shouldn't be any problem in setting up all these variables as\ntheir description and usages are already listed aside them in comments.\nAll variables have been pre-filled out for the purpose of demonstration\nas well.\n\nPlease remember you have to input all variables according to your settings.\nAll variables are compulsory to input. (Only the mentioned variables which\ncan be left as empty/blank \"\" can be left alone)\n\n*IMPORTANT* - ***PLEASE SETUP THE 3 AUTHORIZATION PINS CORRECTLY***\n\nWhile you are setting the variables you will come across the PIN settings\nfor the script. The script has 3 PIN's to be set, for it to work correctly.\nPlease change the current PIN settings to any you want\n(make sure you don't include and special characters).\nFor a safety measure make sure you only use alphabetical characters and\nnumerical values.\n\nPlease make sure all 3 PIN's are different from each other.\n(They are case sensitive as well).\nAfter you have chosen to set the 3 PIN's to any random or known words,\nnumbers you should remember them as you will be using them again.\n\nFor this case, when you will be configuring your 'SPAMKICK.TCL' (the next\nscript) you will need to input these 3 current PIN's in there, making sure\nthey are absolutely same as the ones you are entering now.\nFor a clearer view consider:\n\n    PIN1 in SPAMDETECT.TCL should *exactly match* PIN1 in SPAMKICK.TCL \n    PIN2 in SPAMDETECT.TCL should *exactly match* PIN2 in SPAMKICK.TCL\n    PIN3 in SPAMDETECT.TCL should *exactly match* PIN3 in SPAMKICK.TCL\n\nMeaning PIN1, PIN2 and PIN3 in both of your scripts (spamdetect.tcl and\nspamkick.tcl) should be the same and vice versa.\n\nRemember these PINS are also case sensitive, so please enter them with\nthe correct case-letter settings in both scripts.\n\nIf you fail to set all three PIN's, PIN1, PIN2 and PIN3 correctly and they\ndo not match between both scripts, your script will not run/execute.\n\nIf you do not understand the reason why the PIN's need to be set consider\nthis, if your bot goes offline anyone can use your cycler bot's nick and if\nknowing this scripts settings could exploit your opped channels bot, mainly\naccess on channels. Until the authorization PIN's aren't entered correctly,\nthe opped bot cannot be exploit or used for wrong purposes.\n\nAfter setting in the PIN's correctly and as mentioned above according to the\nproper settings, continue to fill in the other variables as they come along\nby scrolling down one by one.\n\nAll together you should have configured a total of 18 variables, out of\nwhich some could be left blank/empty, mainly the ones near to the end\nof the configuration.\n\nYou will stop editing your variable configuration of your script when you\nsee this logo. Please don't edit anything after this:\n\n     ### Don't edit anything else from this point onwards ###\n\nThat's it! You are done configuring the first script now, you can save the\ntext file 'spamdetect.tcl' and upload it to your shell in your eggdrops/script\ndirectory (If you do not use the default eggdrops /script directory for\nTCL scripts, then you can upload it to the one you use)\n\nAs you are done setting up the first script, now you can go ahead and open\nthe other 'SPAMKICK.TCL' in your Windows NOTEPAD or WORDPAD and start setting\nup its variables.\n\nAfter opening the file 'spamkick.tcl', it would have the same procedure for\nsetting up the variables as the previous file. You can start editing the file\nfrom where it says 'START EDITING VARIABLES FROM HERE!'.\n\nThere are a total of 13 variable settings in this script.\nAll variables need to be setup properly. None should be left \"\" blank\nor empty as then the script might not work properly.\n\nYou can read the comments and usage details on each variables description\nand set them easily. Also I have enlisted pre-set examples of the variables\nfor demonstration.\n\nAfter you have successfully edited and setup all the 13 variables, you don't\nneed to edit anything after where you find a message saying\n'DON'T EDIT ANYTHING ELSE FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS'.\n\nThat's it! you are done with setting up both the scripts now!\nIf you have followed the instructions listed here correctly and comments\nin both script files your scripts should execute perfectly!\n\nNow save the text file and upload the file 'spamkick.tcl' to your shell and\neggdrop's /script directory, or whichever you use for your TCL scripts.\n\nOnce you are done in uploading both TCL files in your scripts directory,\nnow edit both of your eggdrops .CONF (Configuration) files, which would be\nsomething as yourbotnick.conf etc. There should be *2* configuration files\nas there are 2 separate bots for the TCL scripts to run on.\n\nOpen both bot's configuration files and paste the following lines into them:\n(If you have changed your scripts/ dir to something else you might want to\n change that as well)\n\n    - In your CYCLER SPAM bot's .CONF file paste this line in the end \n\n               source scripts/spamdetect.tcl\n\n    - In your OPPED SPAM KICKER bot's .CONF file paste this line in the end\n\n               source scripts/spamdetect.tcl\n\nSave both of your .CONF (Configuration) files. If you have edited them via\na shell editor such as 'pico' you wouldn't need to upload the files onto\nyour shell.\n\nIf you have edited them on Windows NOTEPAD or WORDPAD you will need to upload\nboth of the configuration files on the shells of both the bots respectively.\n\nAfter you have successfully setup, edited the scripts, uploaded them on both\nthe shells of your bots and have also edited both your bot's .CONF\n(configuration) files and have added a link to your TCL scripts at the end of\neach configuration file you maybe go ahead & restart both your eggdrop bots.\n\nGive a last moment check at everything you have configured and edited is okay\nthen you many proceed to restart your eggdrops.\n\nThere are many ways of restarting your eggdrops. One would be to logging into\nthe partyline (DCC) with the bot and typing '.restart' for making them rehash\nand restart themselves. Another way would be to logging into the shell\nprompts killing their processes with their pid no's and then loading them\nagain into the background.\n\nIf you have followed the instructions and setup procedures I have given in\nthis help file as well as in the scripts, once both eggdrops are restarted,\nthey should have starting detecting spammers, and kicking spammer asses.\n\n\n:Bug Reports:\n\nIf you have any suggestions, comments, questions or if you want to\nreport bugs found in this script, please feel free to email me at:\n\n       awyeah@usa.net  /  awyeah@awyeah.org \n\nYou can also contact me on MSN Messenger.\nMy Messenger ID is: awyeah@awyeah.org\n\nI would appreciated if you people would give me feedback on this script.\nI always try to fulfill peoples request (if possible) and try to add\nthem in the release of the newer versions of my scripts.\n\n\n:Versions:\n\nScript versions along with their updates, bug fixes and additions\nare listed below currently in an orderly manner.\n\nv.4.58.ab (18-06-2004)\n\n- Added multiple channel support for both the eggdrop bots.\n  (users can now run this script in more than one channel)\n- Added a *NOTICE* detection trigger for detecting private spam notices.\n- Added multiple cycler bot support. (users can now run more than one\n  cycler bot with the same opped bot on multiple channels).\n- Spam detection words in the word list are customizable. They can\n  be added and modified (wildcards such as \"*\" are also accepted)\n- Added random auto-talk ability for the channel cycler bot to catch more\n  spammers. (users can define their auto-talk word lists and customize the\n  response delay timers)\n- Added a spam reporter feature in the opped bot so it can /msg or /notice\n  any nick or channel and notify their target about the spammer.\n- Added a kick counter to which would display the number of persons kicked\n  in the end of each kick message.\n  (kick number records are stored and read through a file)\n- Added a choice of kick messages, either to kick the spammer with the\n  default script kick message or include the spammers spam message,\n  in the kick message. (Added on request)\n- Added a spammer info record capability in the opped bot. Bot owners can\n  record spammers info such as userhost addresses, nicks, spam messages\n  and then retrieve them later.\n- Added a list 20 of banmasks to select from when banning the spammer. \n- Optimized the channel cycling timers for faster efficiency.\n- The spam detection and cycling channels will be automatically added in\n  the spam cycler bot dynamic channel lists once the bots are loaded in\n  to background.\n- Fixed and correct some bugs found as well as modified most of the\n  procedures for a better and faster performance.\n\nv.2.6.ab (10-5-2004)\n\n- Initial release of the script\n\n\n:Credits:\n\nThanks to everyone who supported me in the making and creation of this script.\n\nAlso a great thanks to my all friends who helped me all the way through this\nproject by beta testing, verifying and correcting the bugs and errors found\nin this script.\n\n\nIRC Network:\n/server irc.dal.net:6667 (The DALnet IRC Network)\nIRC Nick:\nawyeah\nMy Website:\nhttp://www.awyeah.org/\nEggdrop Help:\nhttp://www.egghelp.org/\nTCL Scripts:\nhttp://www.tclscripts.com/\nEmail:\nawyeah@usa.net / awyeah@awyeah.org\n"

Users can choose\n  to switch on exemption of channel operators, voices or users\n  with certain flags in the bots user list.\n\n- This script has a large number of exemption options and\n  switches such as specific nick, ident, host, user@host \n  exemption. Also it has an exemption for non-dynamic idents.\n\n- The ban types are not sticky and are regular channel bans.\n  Eventhough if an innocent user is kicked which has a\n  possibility of 2% out of 100% he would be able to rejoin\n  back and will not be blacklisted by the bot.\n\n- This script will not ban on detecting any single\n  characters/words in a text or action of a user, which will\n  not annoy users and ops.\n\n- This script will also not ban people in the channel, if they\n  say that channels name. \n  For example: If someone on the channel #funchat, says a text\n  which includes the word #funchat the script will ignore it,\n  and that person's text would be exempted. Some scripts which\n  are availiable on the web would punish the user for saying\n  that, which is quite annoying.\n\n- This script also has a channel interface switch. This switch\n  will give an option to choose which type of channel interface\n  to select from such as CHANNEL TEXT, ACTION, NOTICE or ALL\n  when detecting for advertisements in channels.\n\n- Also added a small kick counter script. It will keep a record\n  of how many people are kicked with the script. The record of\n  users kicked will be show in the end of each kick message.\n\n- Availiable are 20 types of bans which can be selected by bot\n  owners with varying wilcards. These banmasks will enforce a\n  greater range of customizable bans for banning spammers.\n\n --\n /awyeah @ DALnet\n"

    "extdesc"     : "\n#! this is the description file for dnsspam.tcl by Daniel 'dubkat' Reidy\n\ndnsspam.tcl is a tcl interface to spamcalc.\n\n# quoated direct from http://spamcalc.net\nWhat is dnsspam?\nIn short, hostnames should be hierarchical.\nSomething like computer.subdomain.domain.tld. Wasting ip space to create\nreverse just to 'look cool' on IRC (because there really is no other\nservice/place on the internet where your reverse is shown) is therefore\ncalled dns pollution or dnsspam. You can find a more extensive\nexplanation on www.dnsspam.nl or on this site.\n\nWhat if it decides a hierarchical host is dnsspam?\nThis is a very very bad thing, of course. I have taken many precautions\nto try to make sure that this does not happen. And so far I have not\nfound a hierarchical hostname that scores 100 or more. A few examples:\n\n14 - port-213-61-45-64.ber.dial.de.colt.net\n0 [whitelisted] - 1Cust197.tnt1.richmond.va.da.uu.net\n0 [whitelisted] - pc1-shep1-4-cust169.not.cable.ntl.com\n0 [whitelisted] - 0-1pool230-2.nas19.philadelphia1.pa.us.da.qwest.net\n0 [whitelisted] - 209-122-217-112.s112.tnt1.atn.pa.dialup.rcn.com\n0 [whitelisted] - cpe.atm0-0-0-132109.0x3ef29916.virnxx4.customer.tele.dk\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Setup:\n1. download spamcalc from http://spamcalc.net/download/ \n  (you want the latest.tgz listed on the page. not the individual files).\n2. tar -xvfz spamcalc-*.gz (there are many files there. the spamcalc\n  binary uses some of those files. so to be safe DONT DELETE ANYTHING).\n3. open dnsspam.tcl in your favorite text editor and edit the line that\n  says 'set spamcalc_path /path/to/spamcalc/binary'\n4. adjust the settings as you see fit. but note that setting the\n  settings too low will ban innocent people and make people\n   throw pies at you.\n5. rehash your bot.\n6. .chanset #channel +spamcalc\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublic Commands:\n\n!spamcalc host.name.to.calculate\n!sc (an alias for !spamcalc)\n\npublic commands will work in any channel the bot is on, even if\nthe channel is set -spamcalc\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEtc...\n\nIf you find any bugs, make additions or change the code in some way,\nlet me know!\nBy the way, this is my first TCL script, and as my skill progresses,\nI may add more functions to the script, and fix bugs, etc.\nCheck my homepage http://www.dubkat.org/ for updates\nand other scripts i may be working on.\n\nEnjoy\n\nDan\naka dubkat @ efnet\n"

Es hat mich (und andere!) schon länger geärgert, wenn ich\nim Channel ganze Listen nickwechselfreuduger Zeitgenossen zum Mergen\neinzugeben hatte. Es war umständlich und nervaufreibend. Noch dazu mußte\nich, um \"reell\" zu bleiben, meinen Nick vor dieser Arbeit freezen und\ndanach unfreezen.\n\nDurch die neuen DCC-Befehle kann man jetzt diese Manipulationen vornehmen,\nohne im Channel die Leute zu nerven. Ein weiterer Effekt ist, daß man\nvorgefertigte Listen sehr schön direkt in die Partyline pasten kann.\nIm Channel gäbe das recht bald Flood-Kick. Auch ist es nützlich, wenn man\n\"unsichtbar\" User freezen und unfreezen kann.\n\nKurzum: Mir sind die neuen Commands nützlich; ich hoffe, sie bringen auch\ndem Einen oder Anderen eine Erleichterung.\n\nGeändert habe ich die TCL (mit den neuen Aufrufen),\ndie Helpfile und die 1_DESCRIPTION.\nDie anderen Files sind nicht verändert und können als\nCHATstats3.1.2.tar.gz bei den TCL-Scripten geladen werden.\nDann einfach die neuen 3 Files über die Originale kopieren.\n\nAutor Baerchen hat mir freundlicherweise erlaubt, diese Änderungen an\nseinem Script zu publizieren.\nIch betone, daß ich nur für diese Änderung zuständig bin; das eigentliche\nScript ist nach wie vor Baerchens Arbeit.\n\nXXanadoo im Dezember 2004.\nXXanadoo@freenet.de\n \n\n---------------------\n*  English here...  *\n---------------------\n\nFour new DCC commands for the partyline for Baerchens ChatStats.\nstatmerge   statdelete   statfreeze   statunfreeze\n\nThis commands shall \"complete\" the DCC commands with functions, they existe\nas channel commands already. But there the using of this command are\nbothering almost - especially \"merge\".\n\nWith the new DCC commands now you can use this functions without be annoying\nthe people in a channel. An additional effekt is, you can paste predefined\nlists (e.g. for multi merging) directly in the Partyline. Without getting a\nflood kick in a channel.

    "extdesc"     : "\nWho Said It?\n\n:About:\n\n\"Who Said It?\" is a game of psychology and bluffing played by three or\nmore people in an IRC channel.  It is a Tcl script which runs under an\nEggdrop bot.\n\nIf you wish to give feedback, or ask questions, come to these forums\nand post a message.  Or, you can try to find me (Pistos) on the\nFreeNode IRC network, in the #mathetes or #geoshell channels.\n\n\n:Example Game:\n\nThe best way to describe the game is with an example.\nLet's look at an IRC log showing a WSI game.\n\n  <Pistos> !wsi\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] The topic is 'def'n: redound'. /msg GeoBot wsi\n       <your submission> -- 40 seconds to submit.\n    \nHere, we see me start a game by typing !wsi into the channel.\nThe bot complies by starting a new game, giving a random topic,\nwith some instructions on what players should do next.\nAt this point, whoever wants to play just gives a submission to\nthe bot by messaging it.  For example, I messaged the bot with:\n\n       /msg GeoBot wsi a red dog\n    \nAfter I submit, the bot gives me an acknowledgement via private NOTICE:\n\n  -GeoBot- [wsi] Your submission has been accepted.\n    \nAn important thing to understand is: There is no right or wrong answer.\nThis is not a trivia game.  The topics are merely there to trigger\nthoughts in the mind, but your submission can be anything at all, even\nsomething totally off topic.\nAfter 40 seconds have passed, the bot will display all the submissions,\nand a list of people who submitted something.\n\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] Answering round over.  /msg GeoBot wsi <submission\n       number> <your nick guess> [<number> <nick> ...]\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 0 - a red dog\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 1 - viagra.\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 2 - it's a red dog, innit\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 3 - the sound of red\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 4 - we won't go there\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] Submitters: Jaykul Pistos Striker`Work nvidhive qu1j0t3\n    \nNow, with the submissions shown, each player must guess who they think\nsaid which line.\nFor example, I thought that:  Striker`Work said \"viagra.\"\nnvidhive said \"it's a red dog, innit\"\nJaykul said \"the sound of red\"\nqu1j0t3 said \"we won't go there\"\nSo, I messaged the bot with:\n\n       /msg GeoBot wsi 1 Str 2 nv 3 ja 4 qu\n    \nThen the bot gave me an acknowledgement of my guesses:\n\n  -GeoBot- [wsi] Acknowledged: You think Striker`Work said that.\n  -GeoBot- [wsi] Acknowledged: You think nvidhive said that.\n  -GeoBot- [wsi] Acknowledged: You think Jaykul said that.\n  -GeoBot- [wsi] Acknowledged: You think qu1j0t3 said that.\n    \nNote how you don't have to use full nicks, just the first one or two\ndistinguishing letters.  It's important to watch for the acknowledgement,\nand to make sure the nick he acknowledges is the one you meant!\nOtherwise, your guess may be attributed to the wrong nick, or worse, not\nrecorded at all.\nAfter all the players have submitted their guesses (or a certain amount of\ntime has elapsed, in the case that some players are too slow), the bot\nwill collect all the guesses, tally the scores, and display the results to\nthe channel.\n\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] Guessing round over.\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 'a red dog' - Pistos ... nvidhive > Jaykul;\n       Striker`Work > nvidhive;  Jaykul > Pistos;\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 'viagra.' - Striker`Work ... Jaykul > Striker`Work;\n       Pistos > Striker`Work;  nvidhive > Striker`Work;\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 'it's a red dog, innit' - qu1j0t3 ... Pistos > nvidhive;\n       nvidhive > Pistos;  Striker`Work > Jaykul;  Jaykul > qu1j0t3;\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 'the sound of red' - nvidhive ... Striker`Work > qu1j0t3;\n       Jaykul > nvidhive;  Pistos > Jaykul;\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] 'we won't go there' - Jaykul ... Pistos > qu1j0t3;\n       nvidhive > Specimen;  Striker`Work > Pistos;\n  <GeoBot> [wsi] Scoring: Pistos: 0; Striker`Work: -3; qu1j0t3: -1;\n       nvidhive: 0; Jaykul: +4;\n    \nScoring is simple: You get one point for every correct guess you made,\nbut you lose one point if someone guesses you.\nLet's look at my scoring as an example.\n\nMy submission was \"a red dog\". Jaykul correctly guessed that it was I who\nsaid that, so I lose a point (-1).\n\nI correctly guessed that Striker`Work said \"viagra.\", so I get a point\nfrom that (+1).\n\nI thought nvidhive was the one that submitted \"it's a red dog, innit\",\nbut in fact, it was qu1j0t3 that gave that line, so I get no points for\nthat guess (0).\n\nI also did not guess who said \"the sound of red\" correctly. No points for\nthat, either, nor for my incorrect guess of \"we won't go there\".\n\nTherefore, my total score is zero. (-1 + 1 = 0)\n\nJaykul, however, scored very well (+4).\nHe correctly identified everyone else's line, and nobody guessed that\nhe said \"we won't go there\".\n\n\n:Commands:\n\n!wsi        : Starts a new WSI game.\n!wsiscore   : Prints the all-time scores to the channel.\n!wsiabort   : Aborts a game in progress.\n"

It allows users who have\nsufficient access (which you set in the configuration) to add and\ndisplay quotes in the channels you set it up to work in.\n\nIt's a great way to add a bit of fun to your channels by taking\nthings people say out of context and playing them back for others\nto see later.  You can play back a random quote with !q or get a\nmore specific random quote by specifying a search string\nwith !q [searchstring].\nQuotes are added with the !addq <quote> command.\n\nThere are also partyline commands you may access while dccing the\nbot for listing quotes that are stored, and for removing quotes.\n\nI've tried to keep everything as simple as possible...\nThe configuration for the script is contained at the beginning of\nthe script's tcl file.  The script will run directly out of the box\nwith very little modification, but if you wish to change the flags\nrequired by users on the channels to restrict access to the channel\nand partyline functions, you may do so.\n\nSetup:\n------\n\nIt takes very little to set up the quotescript.\nFirst extract  legomans_quotescript_v1.2.0.zip  to your eggdrop's\nscripts/ directory.\nAdd a line to the bottom of your eggdrop.conf file:\n\nsource scripts/legomans_quotescript_v1.2.0.tcl\n\nSave your eggdrop.conf configuration.\n\nOpen legomans_quotescript_v1.2.0.tcl and edit the configuration\nsettings at the top of the file.  At the very least you must\nspecify what channels you want the quotescript to operate on.\nYou can also change the permissions required to use certain\ncommands added by the script, and change the place where the\nuote database is saved.\n\nOnce the configuration is set up the way you want it, save the\nlegomans_quotescript_v1.2.0.tcl  file.\n\nIf your bot is already running, you can activate the script by\nsimply rehashing the bot.\nType on the partyline or in a telnet connection to the bot:\n\n.rehash\n\nIf your bot isn't running, simply start it, and it will be running\nthe quotescript!  You can type  .helpqs  on the partyline at any\ntime to see a list of help topics.\n\nBugs:\n-----\n\nIf you find any bugs or are having any trouble with the script,\nplease feel free to email me at:\n\nquotescript@legoman.phpnet.us\n\nPlease include a detailed description of the problem.\n\nThanks:\n-------\n\nI'd like to thank SUNiNET for giving me a place to start when it\ncomes to tcl scripting.  Also, Omfg of #Chatzone on Undernet running\nprevious versions of the script and serving as a guinea pig for\ntesting.  And lastly, I'd like to thank whoever wrote the\nquotescript that Omfg was running before mine for giving me a reason\nto write a better one. ;)\n\nPeace,\n\nLegoMan\n"

    "extdesc"     : "\nMailbot - IRC messaging system\n\nFrequently, IRC channels are used as a collaboration tool.\nDue to the real-time nature of IRC, it is hard to keep up with events\nwhen you are offline. The Mailbot script solves that problem.\nIt provides a unified messaging service in form of an interactive IRC bot.\nUsers are able to post to messages to channels, for other users to come\nand read them later. As well, the script allows the users to send private\nmessages to each other. This is useful in cases where the recipient is not\nonline, yet a message be sent to him/her (just like offline messages\nin ICQ).\nThe service is implemented as a TCL script for eggdrop.\nIt uses sqlite for the backend database storage, and AES for encryption.\nIt has extensive search capabilities.\n\n::Sections::\n\n   1. Example Scenario\n   2. Installation\n         1. Installation of the Prerequisites\n         2. Installation of the TCL Script\n         3. Configuring the Mailbot\n   3. Working with Mailbot\n         1. Initializing the Database\n         2. User Authentication and Authorization\n         3. Sending and Receiving Messages\n         4. Searching Messages\n         5. Adjusting Time Zone Settings\n   4. Download\n         1. Subversion\n         2. Changelog\n   5. References\n\n::Example Scenario::\n\nThis scenario presents a typical usage pattern of the bot: users posting\nmessages, and other users reading them at a later time.\nSuppose we have a channel #cooltalk, with 3 regulars: Bob, Alice and Jeff.\nUsers Bob joins channel #cooltalk, & posts an announcement using the bot:\n\n    (in #cooltalk)\n    <Bob> !mail add Hey guys! I will be away next week so please forward\n          all your concerns about the project to Jeff.\n    <MAILBOT> Message number 1 posted to channel #cooltalk.\n     * Bob has left the channel \n\nAt this point, the mail bot stores the message in the pool for channel\n#cooltalk, so other users can read it.\n\nNow, a bit later, Alice joins #cooltalk. She receives a private message\nfrom the mail bot telling her that she has unread mail:\n\n    (in private query with MAILBOT)\n    <MAILBOT> You have unread mail.\n    <Alice> !mail read\n    <MAILBOT>   MESSAGES TO #cooltalk  \n    <MAILBOT> 1. 26.10.2007 15:42:27 Bob: Hey guys! I will be away next\n       week so please forward all your concerns about the project to Jeff.\n\nThen, Jeff joins the channel and reads the same message.  He has a\npersonal question to Bob about the project. However, Bob is offline.\nSo, Jeff sends a private message to Bob using the mail bot\n(in private query):\n\n    (in private query with MAILBOT)\n    <Jeff> !mail send Bob Listen Bob, there was a problem with the\n           project. The database is corrupted.\n    <MAILBOT> Private message number 7 sent to user Bob. \n\nBob, an incurable IRC addict, joins IRC but wants to stay away from\n#cooltalk so no one bothers him.\nHowever, he can still interact with the mail bot:\n\n    (in private query with MAILBOT)\n    <Bob> !mail read\n    <MAILBOT>   PRIVATE MESSAGES  \n    <MAILBOT> 7. 28.10.2007 11:12:55 Jeff: Listen Bob, there was a\n              problem with the project. The database is corrupted. \n\n::Installation::\n\nThe installation of the script involves the installation of the\nprerequisites (tcllib, sqlite), the actual TCL script, as well as\ntweaking the configuration files.\nInstallation of the Prerequisites\n\nMailbot requires the following prerequisites:\n                           Tcllib and the SQLite TCL bindings.\nTcllib comes standard on recent Tcl installations.\nSpecifically, mailbot uses the aes, base64, and crc packages from tcllib.\nSo, if you do not want to bother install all of tcllib, you can just copy\nthe directories of those packages and include them in the eggdrop\nconfiguration file for your bot (described in detail later).\nThe SQLite TCL bindings are required so the mailbot script can use sqlite\ndatabases. The script has been coded against version 3 of sqlite.\nTypically, the name of the bindings library is libtclsqlite3.so on UNIX,\nand something like tclsqlite3_5_0.dll on Windows.\nThere is a commercial version of SQLite that allows databases to be\npassword protected. Such version is not needed for the mailbot, as it\nimplements its own encryption layer on top of the free version of sqlite\nusing tcllib's aes and base64 packages.\nIf you have trouble loading the sqlite bindings binaries into your bot,\nand receive weird error messages like\n   tclsqlite-3.5.1.so: undefined symbol: sqlite3StrICmp\nthen you should probably download the source code to sqlite, compile it\nyourself, and use the libtclsqlite3.so.0.8.6 binary instead\n(it should compile into the .libs directory in the sqlite source tree).\nInstallation of the TCL Script\n\nThis step describes how to install the actual mailbot TCL script into\nyour eggdrop bot.\n\n   1. Unpack mailbot-1.01.tar.gz into eggdrop/scripts. This will create\n      eggdrop/scripts/mailbot-1.01 that will contain the TCL files.\n   2.\n\n      Edit the eggdrop configuration file for your bot:\n           include the sqlite module and the script:\n\n      #\n      # Load the sqlite TCL bindings module.\n      # N.B. Read the 'Installation of Prerequisites' step above in\n      #      detail, if you encounter errors when executing this line.\n      #\n      load libtclsqlite3.so\n\n      #\n      # Include the tcllib prerequisites.\n      # If you have the Tcllib normally installed, you may replace\n      # these with 'package require' lines instead, like so:\n      #\n      #   package require aes\n      #   package require base64\n      #   package require crc\n      #\n      # Though, source lines work just as well :P\n      # Just be sure to adjust the paths to suit your system.\n      #\n      source tcllib1.10/aes/aes.tcl\n      source tcllib1.10/base64/base64.tcl\n      source tcllib1.10/crc/crc32.tcl\n\n      #\n      # Finally, include the mailbot script.\n      # N.B. The scripts/ subdirectory is relative to your location\n      #      of your eggdrop binary.\n      #\n      source scripts/mailbot-1.0/mailbot.tcl\n\n::Configuring Mailbot::\n\n   1.\n\n      The mailbot package comes with two TCL files:\n          - mailbot.tcl - the actual code,  and\n          - mailbot-options.tcl - the configuration file for the script.\n            It is included into mailbot.tcl by mailbot.tcl on line 13.\n            It contains 2 variables that you should change\n             - the path to the database file which will store all the\n               messages, as well the top-level command that access the\n               mailbot functionality.\n               This is usually set to !mail or !news.\n\n      ####################################################################\n      # mailbot-options.tcl - options for mailbot.tcl\n      ####################################################################\n\n      #\n      # Path to the database file\n      #\n      variable db_path \"/home/comrade/eggdrop/mail.db\"\n\n      #\n      # Public access command name\n      #\n      variable pub_cmdname \"!mail\"\n\n   2. Copy blank.db to the database path that you specified above,\n      and make the file writable.\n\n\nThis concludes the installation.\n\n::Working with Mailbot::\n\nThis section deals with interacting with the mailbot script once it is\nup and running on top of an eggdrop bot.\n\nInitializing the Database\n\nUpon running the bot, the mailbot script needs to be initialized by a\nbot administrator (anyone with +m or +n flag on the bot).\nThis is done by messaging the bot in private:\n\n    (in private query with MAILBOT)\n    <BotAdmin> !mail init 0 bigapple.\n    <MAILBOT> Database not initialized: checksums do not match.\n              The correct checksum for bigapple is 243.\n    <MAILBOT> NOTE: Initializing the database with the incorrect password\n              can inflict irreparable damages. Please double-check the\n              password or the checksum for typos.\n\n    <BotAdmin> !mail init 243 bigapple.\n    <MAILBOT> Database initialized. \n\nThis step is necessary to keep the database password out of the\nconfiguration file. If the password would be hardcoded anywhere in the\nconfiguration or the script, anyone with shell access can find out the\npassword.\nNote: this step has to be repeated every time the bot is\n      rehashed or restarted.\nThe purpose of the checksum is to prevent typos.\nIf you would like to skip this step, and hardcode the database password\ninto the configuration file, you may add the following line to the\nend of mailbot.tcl:\n\n#\n# Automatically initialize the database with the password 'bigapple'.\n#\n\nmail::initialize \"bigapple\"\n\nBe aware of the security risks associated with doing so.\n\n::User Authentication and Authorization::\n\nThe mailbot script uses the built-in eggdrop userbase to authenticate\nusers. The user's handle on the bot is used as the user's name when\nposting messages.\nA user's channel access is determined by the user's channel record on\nthe bot. Any user with a +v flag on the channel is allowed to\nsend/receive messages from that particular channel. However,\nprivate messages can be sent/received by the user without any particular\nchannel access records.\nSuperusers are the users that are able to initialize the database.  Any\nuser with a +m or +n global flags on eggdrop is considered a superuser.\n\n::Sending and Reading Messages::\n\nTo get help on sending, and reading messages, please invoke the help menu\nfrom the bot directly by typing !mail help\n(substitute !mail with your own command if you changed it).\n\n::Searching Messages::\n\nThe mailbot script features extensive search capabilities with many ways\nto filter the results. The search feature can be accessed through the\n!mail search [filters] [keywords] command.\nKeyword matching is case-insensitive.\nThe possible filters are:\n\n1. -before:YYYY-MM-DD to search only messages before a specific date.\n2. -after:YYYY-MM-DD to search only messages after and including a\n    specific date.\n3. -ago:num_days to search only messages from up to num_days ago.\n4. -from:user to search only messages sent by the user user.\n5. -to:channel to search only messages sent to the channel.\n6. -any to make the filter match any one of the keywords from the list.\n    if not specified, all keywords must be matched.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n * !news search -before:2007-11-01 -after:2007-10-01 -from:leonidas\n   this is sparta\n      -> searches for all mail for the month of October 2007, sent by\n         leonidas, and containing all of the keywords this, is and sparta\n         (not necessarily in that order).\n * !news search -any color flavor\n      -> searches for all mail containing either the keyword color,\n         or the keyword flavor.\n * !news search -to:#cooltalk database\n      -> searches for the mail sent to channel #cooltalk containing\n         the keyword database.\n\n::Adjusting Time Zone Settings::\n\nYou can adjust the local time zone with the\n!mail timezone <+/- minutes> command.\nThe offsets are relative to the bot's local time (unfortunately, TCL does\nnot provide UTC time, so the offsets are guesswork unless you know where\nthe bot is). For example, if the bot displays times that are 1 hour ahead\nof my time, I would simply type !mail timezone -60 to make the adjustment.\nThe offset is in granularity of minutes, which makes it compatible\nwith Venezuela.\n\n\nDownload:\nmailbot-1.01.tar.gz (8 KB)\n\nOlder versions:\nmailbot-1.0.tar.gz (8 KB)\n\nThe project is released under the BSD license.\n\nSubversion:\nThe subversion repository for the project can be accessed here:\n   http://mailbot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mailbot/.\n\nChangelog:\nThe changelog can be also be accessed here:\n   http://mailbot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mailbot/trunk/?view=log.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nr4 | comrade64 | 2007-11-01 01:31:59 -0400 (Thu, 01 Nov 2007) | 4 lines\n\nversion 1.01:\n- fixed aes encryption oddity on some strings\n- fixed bold irc string escaping on some strings\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nr2 | comrade64 | 2007-11-01 01:29:32 -0400 (Thu, 01 Nov 2007) | 1 line\n\ninitial import of mailbot-1.0\n\n::References::\n\n* Mailbot SF.net Project Page - mailbot at sourceforge.\n* Eggdrop - The official home of Eggdrop development and the Eggdev team.\n* SQLite - The official homepage of SQLite, the embedded database engine.\n* Tcllib - Core development home for the tcllib standardized Tcl library.\n"

All Game-Pool Commands                        #\n#                                                                            #\n# -> Game-Pool can keep track of any number of different game-pools,         #\n#    as provided in the script setting:  gpool(games)                        #\n# -> So, in our example:     ff Fortress Forever                             #\n#                            tfc

   #\n#       represented by the game codes:  ff, tfc, & tf2                       #\n# -> That would make the actual !pool commands something more like:          #\n#         !poolff      :to open a Fortress Forever game-pool                 #\n#         !pooltfc     :to open a Team Fortress Classic game-pool            #\n#         !pooltf2     :to open a Team Fortress 2 game-pool                  #\n# -> This same system applies to all of the below Game-Pool commands.        #\n#    Some more examples:                                                     #\n#         !poolff 4    :to open a

It is placed in\n     addon. You have to make normal row - part of your table already you\n     written in template set htmlrewards\n\n<tr id='sol'><a href='#' id='sol'><td>#CBnumber</td><td>#host</td>\n<td>#rewardpoints</td><td>#relfalg</td><td>#timeleft</td></a></tr>\n\n     #CBnumber #host #rewardpoints #relfalg #timeleft placed as a\n     substitute for real data and arbitrarily invented they will need\n     in the next option\n\n   - third option is like simply string map first with one of you allready\n     specify options #CBnumber #host #rewardpoints #relfalg #timeleft then\n     logical substitute. Substitute itself is made by substitute symbols\n     Legend of substitute symbols:\n             < = {, > = }, ( = [, ) = ], ' = \", -> = >, <- = <\n     You can see no variables here. They are here! The main are:\n             #host - user host #score - game score #dtame - last guess.\n     All ADDons who save in db have some of them. Search in ADDon section\n     \nset htmlcombrewards \"#rewardpoints <(string map '0 (expr #score - (string\n                     map {- 1} #Rpoints))' (expr 0 -> #score - (string\n                     map {- 1} #Rpoints)))> \"\n\n    or more clearly you can see this:\nset htmlcombrewards \"#rewardpoints {[string map \"0 [expr #score - [string\n                     map {- 1} #Rpoints]]\" [expr 0 > #score - (string\n                     map {- 1} #Rpoints]]]} \"\n    AND\n    string map $htmlcombrewards $htmlrewards\n#############################################REWARDS addon################\nGives auto-rewards to users (flag)\n##########################NEW CHANGES#####################################\n- New logical connections for the ADDon. All rules from old game exists\n  only options are diferent.\n- New example reward table looks like this:\nset rewards { \n {\"+o\"  \"C\" \"10000\" \"10\" \"30\"}\n {\"+v\"  \"C\" \"5000\" \"0\" \"0\"}\n {\"-hp|f\"  \"B\" \"100000\" \"10\" \"7\"}\n}\nDo not remove {}.\nI add for example how to add +f flag on your bot and to show you\nmultiply adding of flags. You can do this with your channel flags too. \n- new way for $resetrew which reset all players who don't have rewards.\n  You only need to specify period in days.\n\n# commands #######################################################DCC#####\n- Moderators Only -\n .cb -rewards <nick> flag +f       (changes flag to +f)\n .cb -rewards <nick> flag - (change flag to normal user & delete duration)\n .cb -rewards <nick> duration +2   (+2 days reward time)\n .cb -rewards <nick> duration -2   (-2 days reward time)\n .cb -rewards <nick> duration 2    (sets duration on 2 days from now)\n .cb -rewards <nick> duration -    (changes reward time to forever)\n .cb -rewards <nick> reset <nick>  (resets all rewards stats for user)\n .cb -rewards <nick> info          (shows you info to a user)\n- All Users -\n !info     -> public comand show to users their info\n\n\n# cb substitute to be used in htmlCB #####################################\n   #Rpoints - reward points who bot gives when drops user\n   #Rflag   - rewards flag\n   #RtimeL  - reward timer\n################################EXPLANE FOR ADDON#########################\n The idea is users to get some rewards for scores they get.\n Like 7 days op or voice. :) 1 month +f. \n    If you have bots wich have a lot of options and you set some commands\n    only for those users who have +f others will have to play C&B game and\n    yell point to get +f status. See what i mean. Use this addon for good\n    and make your chanel with best population ;)\n    - REWARDS ADDon have simple structure.\n      Have 1 rewards table $rewards variable. Here you set your rewards\n      EXAMPLE: \n           set rewards { \n                {\"+o\"  \"C\" \"10000\" \"10\" \"30\"}\n                {\"+v\"  \"C\" \"5000\" \"0\" \"0\"}\n                {\"+f\"  \"B\" \"100000\" \"10\" \"7\"}\n                {\"+m\"  \"B\" \"20000000\" \"1\" \"10\"}\n            }\n     1. First column you set your flag it can be + or - <flag>\n     2. Specify C - Channel flags or B - Bot flags (for bot flags search\n        in google for 'eggdrop flags')     \n     3. This is score who some user have to done to be rewarded. In case\n        if some user have 5000 points gets +v if he got 10000 - +v\n        changes to +o.\n     4. 4 column is people limit. If you have 10 ops that means no other\n        have reward +o before some reward expire (if expire). \n     5. Next column is for rewards expire in days. \n        Last 2 columns for limit and expire period has option - if you\n        leave it 0 have no limit and expire period is forever. \n        If some user have for example NONE expire period and after that\n        you set in reward table some period this user have no expire\n        period until you change it manual or after current user change\n        reward level. Same is with limits if you set some limit after\n        limit was empty and people are more that limits is no one gets\n        this reward before rewards expire. \n  - next: important setting is:     set resetrew \"2\"\n        This is option who makes reset to all results every <days> you\n        specify. You set how many days to wait rewards timer. This option\n        not reset people who have rewards. They have diferent timers and\n        if they don't get new rewards before expire period they reset his\n        score (if have reset period). This option you can leave it 0\n        (means is off).\n\n############################teams addon###################################\nI add new addon that will separate your channel to teams.\nThey will compete among themselves.\nAnyone can make a team and invite friends.\n\n##########################NEW CHANGES#####################################\n# commands #####################################################DCC#######\n + user commands: (on private)\nteams new <name of team> - creates team\nteams rename <new name> - rename your team\nteams delete - delete your team\nteams invite <nick> - invites nick to join your team \n  - have flood protection (people who do not accept your invitation)\n  - you can invite only active cb players which are in cb channel\n  - you can't invite people who allready have teams or DND users\nteams leave - leave team\nteams DND - set your status to DND and this stops all team join requests\nteams tjoin - makes team owner to join his own team if he was member of\n              diferent team when he was created his own\nWhen you receive an invitation you can use:\n refuse - refuse invitation\n join - you join team\n  + moderators commands: (on DCC)\n .cb -teams delete <team name> - to delete team\n .cb -teams rename <team name> <new name> - to rename obscene names \n# cb substitute to be used in htmlCB #####################################\n #teams - all teams information 'owner#membership'\n##########################################################################\nHow to play.\n    Link for wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows\n##########################################################################\nNOTE:\nFor eggdrops:\nyour bot need to have permissions to write and store files in directories.\n\nFor windrops:\nif you have problems with vista, win7 permissions run eggdrop.exe\nas administrator for instalation. \n  \nAll bugs in original version of the game is supported\n            (gameoverbg@gmail.com).\nAll other questions for game mods is not supportable.\n"

But be carefull\nAnd We assure that Egg2 has access on Egg1\n  (The flag local +o is the default)\nNow we finished.\n\nEgg2 will cycle the chan..and messages on users on join and if\nhe gets spammed he will message to Egg1 and the Egg1 will ban\nthe abuser !\n\nIt`s a smart Package so be free to try it :)\n"

just tell us what you need!\n             We can create almost anything in TCL based on your ideas and donations. \n    Email: blackshadow@tclscripts.net or info@tclscripts.net with your request informations \n                            and we'll contact you as soon as possible.\n\n                                      -----------------------\n\n   Ideas, suggestions, comments ?\n\n      This script is free of charge but I accept donations, old computers, free shells :))\n      In any case, if you have any comment (good or bad) go to http://tclscripts.net.\n\nMinimum requirements:\n     o Eggdrop 1.8.x\n     o Tcl 8.5 or higher.\n\nMost important features:\n\n    o Multi-channels support: intelligent IRC channel management, every owner(s)/manager(s) can\n      customise this script and its component settings for each channel to his liking.\n      (add/remove users, activate or disable desired protections, modules or commands)\n    o Global boss owner(s) now have the possibility of being able to modify, directly into, their\n      eggdrop config file (eggdrop.conf) without having to log on to the shell machine to do that. \n      (i.e. nickname, realname, homechan, chanserv, chanserv username, chanserv password, etc.)\n    o Designed for flexibility and ease of use: BlackTools is now 100% flexible to be configured\n      via channel, you can set different settings for each channel.\n    o Owner(s) timer module system which allows to start timers to execute certain processes (proc)\n      and in case you want to kill/stop a timer you can do this through this module too. \n      Also provides and a list of active timers running.\n    o Allows you to upload files that match the pattern *.tcl from a url inside your\n      eggdrop's scripts directory.\n    o Note module system where users can send messages to each other or save personal notes. \n      Also, eggdrop will send notes to global owner(s) to inform them every time is abused\n      (banned/can't join a channel).\n    o CIDR support, dnslookup support and webirc hosts support.\n    o All commands works through private message (PRIVMSG) and possibility that all users, who have\n      access to eggdrop, can set their own cmdchar such as '!'.\n    o All the warn/kick/ban reasons are highly customizable. \n      Every channel manager can add or remove anything as want easily.\n    o The new BlackTools version brings also a new and very well-implemented ban system which performs\n      accurate and efficient searches through global banlist and every channel banlists for a better\n      management and an easier removal/unban.\n    o Perfect navigational system through the pages of every module which has this option and a \n      quote support system module.\n    o Protection against botnet (mass) and private floods.\n    o And lots of cool features for your eggdrop :)\n\nImportant:\n\n     Read BlackTools MANUAL (.man command) for help and information about configuration.\n     Read INSTALL file to know how to install it.\n     Read FAQ file for the most frequently asked questions.\n\nCredits:\n\n    o Settore for hosting the tclscripts.net project website.\n

So what i have done is when you sop someone it\nwill identify to chanserv and then sop the person as with the remove\nsop.\n\nThis script also has a channel uflag so it will only work in\nchannels that are marked with +chanserv . Which is nice if you have\nyour bot in other channels that you dont want them commands to work\non BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT YOU EGGDROP TO TRY TO IDENTIFY TO OTHER\nCHANNELS..\n\nThis script will work on all networks that run with chanserv some\nverify like dalnet uses chanserv@services.dal.net if your on dalnet\nyou may need to use this..So you would change the\nset chanserv \"chanserv\" to set chanserv \"chanserv@services.dal.net\"\nbut the defult chanserv may work for it as well ..\n\nI will also take suggestions on new features for this script\n\nChanserv Script Release Date February 20,2009\n\nPlease do not modify my code thanks...\n"

This is an acro game with slightly different game play and scoring.\n\nLike be-acro, myacro starts each round by generating a random string of\nletters.  3 or more players submit phrases they think best fit the random\nletters.  When time is up, the players who submitted acros vote for each\nother's submissions.  The acro with the most votes gets a bunch of points.\n\nFast voting is NOT rewarded in myacro.  Take your time and fully appreciate\nthe subtleties and cleverness of your fellow players' acros before voting.  On\nthe other hand, fast acro creation is rewarded -- but only if the acro is good\nenough to earn people's votes.\n\nEach vote counts as one point.  Even if an acro is not the highest scoring\nsubmission, it still earns a point toward the game total for each vote it\nreceives.  Bonus points are awarded for the most popular acro, as well as the\nfirst acro submitted receiving votes.  Points are cancelled for people who do\nnot vote.\n\nIf the bot detects trash talk, it will issue a challenge.  The person talking\nsmack will be forced to put up or shut up.  The challenger and the challengee\nwill compete for each other's points.  The winner steals 5 points from the\nloser.  If there's a tie, the challenger still loses a point for being a punk.\n\nGame play experience shows that people are going to bend the rules from time\nto time.  They'll insert extra words, attaching them to other words with a\nhyphen or underscore.  myacro allows fudging of a word here and there (the\ntolerance setting is configurable within the tcl), so people can feel more\ncomfortable including an \"a, an, the, of, for,\" etc. regardless of whether\nthe random letters would accomodate it.  Ultimately, it's up to the voters to\ndecide whether the cleverness of the acro justifies the rule bending.\n\nThis script requires either the SQLite library or a MySQL server, plus a TCL\ninterface for one or the other.  Read the README file included in the tarball\nfor full details.\n"

Activities include joined,\n# parted, kicked, quit, nick change, spoke, and action. If status is\n# not found script will check channels nick list. If nick isn't in\n# channel then a pattern search will be performed instead and results\n# displayed. Script also includes the ability to search for nicks by\n# hostmask using the host parameter. As well as an automatic backup\n# system that saves on .die, restart, timed intervals.\n#\n# *Configuration options can be changed using the dcc command 'statusd'.\n# Configurable options include all listed in configuration section.\n# \n# Initial channel setup:\n# (starts logging and enables public status command.

Script configuration settings\n#  are now saved & restored through the backup system as well as with\n#  '.statusd load' and '.statusd store' commands via dcc/partyline.\n#  2.Removed backup_trigger & its configuration options since backups\n#  can be performed via dcc/partyline. Also a couple other minor fixes.\n#  3.Script now checks if nick is in channel when a status is not found.\n#  If nick is not in channel then a pattern search will be performed\n#  and results returned.\n#  4.Fixed bug that caused nick patterns with * symbols to trigger\n#  'currently in chan' responses.\n#  5.Modified pattern search to also search channel nick list for\n#  matching names.\n#  6.Added chancheck function to validate specified channels.\n#  This fixes a bug related to users specifying channels that the bot\n#  has not joined.\n#  7.Fixed configuration system to eliminate the extra binds leftover\n#  after changing command trigger & configuration via partyline.\n"

So it should work fine on this version of eggdrop and\nhigher. If you find any bug on this script, you can open a bug repport on Github https://github.com/solbu/eggdrop-scripts\n\nFeatures:\n---------\nThis script will voice any user who joins a channel specified after a preset minimum and maximum time.\nThe script also tracks nick changes, so users will get voice even if they change nick before the bot voice them.\nDefault is to randomly delay voice to between 60 and 99 seconds.\n"
